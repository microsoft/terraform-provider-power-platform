# Title

Unoptimized Slice Allocation in `convertDtoToModel` Function

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/analytics_data_export/models.go`

## Problem

In the `convertDtoToModel` function, slices such as `environments`, `status`, and `scenarios` are allocated with an initial capacity using `make([]types.String, 0, len(dto.Environments))`. While this technique prevents frequent reallocation, it does not account for cases where the real size of filtered or transformed data might be smaller than `len(dto.<field>)`.

## Impact

Although this issue has low severity, it can lead to minor inefficient memory usage when working with large DTOs, especially if fields like `dto.Environments` contain numerous entries and many get filtered out during processing. It does not crash the application but affects performance.

## Location

The problem occurs wherever slices are preallocated in the `convertDtoToModel` function, such as:

## Code Issue

```go
environments := make([]types.String, 0, len(dto.Environments))
for _, env := range dto.Environments {
    environments = append(environments, types.StringValue(env.EnvironmentId))
}

// Similarly in scenarios and status mapping.
scenarios := make([]types.String, 0, len(dto.Scenarios))
status := make([]StatusModel, 0, len(dto.Status))
```

## Fix

Consider using dynamic allocation and allowing the size to grow naturally. Alternatively, review the specific filtering and transformation logic to determine a better estimate of the preallocation size.

Here is the adjusted code using dynamic slice growth:

```go
environments := []types.String{}
for _, env := range dto.Environments {
    environments = append(environments, types.StringValue(env.EnvironmentId))
}

// Similarly apply this technique for other slice allocations:
scenarios := []types.String{}
status := []StatusModel{}
```

Although this introduces some trade-offs in terms of performance under heavy allocations, it ensures the slice memory usage reflects real-size requirements.
