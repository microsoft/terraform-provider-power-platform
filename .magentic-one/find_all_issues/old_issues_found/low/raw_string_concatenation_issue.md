# Issue Report: Dependency on Raw String Concatenation to Build URL Paths

## File Path:
`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/tenant/api_tenant.go`

## Problem
Direct usage of raw string concatenation when setting the `Path` field of `apiUrl`. For example, in the line:
```go
Path: "/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/tenant",
```

Hardcoding paths in this manner is prone to errors and is less maintainable, especially when managing longer or dynamic paths for APIs. A typo or modification could lead to runtime issues that are harder to debug.

## Impact

- Increased risk of accidental typos in string paths, leading to unexpected API failures.
- Maintenance challenges when paths need modification across multiple files.
- Code readability suffers when developers need to repeatedly parse concatenated strings to understand the endpoint.

## Severity:
***Low***

## Location
Line 21 in the following block:
```go
Path: "/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/tenant",
```

## Code Issue
```go
Path: "/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/tenant",
```

## Recommendation / Fix
Use a centralized mechanism for URL path management via constants or utility functions. This ensures consistency and maintainability.

### Suggested Code Fix
```go
Path: constants.TenantApiPath,
```

And in the `constants` package:
```go
const TenantApiPath = "/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/tenant"
```

This approach centralizes all raw strings related to paths in one place, making updates easier and reducing risk.
