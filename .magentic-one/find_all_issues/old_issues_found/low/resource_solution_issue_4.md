# Title

Unused Import Statement: `os`

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution/resource_solution.go

## Problem

The `os` package is imported but not utilized across methods in the file, indicating dead code.

## Impact

While it does not directly affect functionality, unused imports can clutter the codebase and reduce readability.

**Severity:** Low

## Location

Line 5:

```go
"os"
```

## Fix

Remove the unused import statement to clean up the code.

```go
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"strings"
	... // other imports
)
```

This improves code clarity and adheres to clean coding practices.
