# Title

Incorrect capitalization in JSON tag

## Path

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connection/dto.go

## Problem

In the `permissionPropertiesDto` struct, the field `NotifyShareTargetOption` has an inconsistent capitalization in its JSON tag, which is set as `"NotifyShareTargetOption"`. Best practices recommend using lowerCamelCase for JSON keys (e.g., `"notifyShareTargetOption"`) to align with the naming conventions of most APIs.

## Impact

The inconsistent case can cause interoperability issues with systems expecting lowerCamelCase JSON keys. Severity is low since this is primarily an aesthetic or conventional issue and won't break functionality unless integrated systems enforce strict case sensitivity.

## Location

```go
permissionPropertiesDto struct {
    NotifyShareTargetOption string       `json:"NotifyShareTargetOption"`
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
NotifyShareTargetOption string `json:"NotifyShareTargetOption"`
```

## Fix

Change the JSON tag to lowerCamelCase for consistency:

```go
NotifyShareTargetOption string `json:"notifyShareTargetOption"`
```

This aligns with JSON naming conventions adopted by most APIs, ensuring better readability and integration.
