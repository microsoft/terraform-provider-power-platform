# Title

Inconsistent Use of `cancel()` in `TestUnitSleepWithContext_HappyPath`

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/api/client_test.go`

## Problem

The test `TestUnitSleepWithContext_HappyPath` calls the `cancel()` function to clean up the context, but the `cancel()` function is invoked after the test assertion. This is not a critical issue but could lead to negligence in future cases where resources related to the context are required to be released on time.

## Impact

- **Severity: Low**
- Inappropriate cleanup timing may not manifest issues here but sets a bad precedent for other tests, potentially leading to resource leaks in more complex use cases.

## Location

Line 89 (or nearby, based on exact code-loaded view):

```go
	cancel()
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
	ctx := context.Background()
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, time.Duration(5)*time.Second)
	err := a.SleepWithContext(ctx, time.Duration(1)*time.Second)
	if err != nil {
		t.Error("Expected to complete without error but got an error")
	}

	cancel()
}
```

## Fix

Move the `cancel()` invocation immediately after the context creation to ensure the cleanup is always done at the appropriate time, regardless of whether the test passes or fails.

```go
	ctx := context.Background()
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, time.Duration(5)*time.Second)
	defer cancel() // Ensures cleanup at the end of function execution

	err := a.SleepWithContext(ctx, time.Duration(1)*time.Second)
	if err != nil {
		t.Error("Expected to complete without error but got an error")
	}
}
```
