# Title

Incorrect spelling present in log message variables

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/authorization/resource_user.go`

## Problem

The variable naming and logging messages contain spelling errors such as `eviroment` instead of `environment`. Misspellings are confusing and can lead to misunderstandings for users and developers reading logs, making debugging more difficult.

## Impact

This issue has a **low severity** since it only affects readability of the log messages but does not impact functionality. It can affect user trust and make logs harder to interpret.

## Location

Incorrect spelling located here:
```go
tflog.Debug(ctx, fmt.Sprintf("Dataverse exist in eviroment %t", hasEnvDataverse))
```

## Code Issue

### Example

```go
tflog.Debug(ctx, fmt.Sprintf("Dataverse exist in eviroment %t", hasEnvDataverse))
```

## Fix

Correct the spelling in the log messages.

### Corrected Code

```go
tflog.Debug(ctx, "Dataverse exists in environment:", hasEnvDataverse)
```

### Explanation

A simple spelling correction improves code readability and log message clarity, which enhances debugging and communication.
