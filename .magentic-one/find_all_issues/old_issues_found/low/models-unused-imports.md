# Title

Unused Imports in Package

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/models.go`

## Problem

The file imports `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-timeouts/resource/timeouts`, `github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/helpers`, and `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/types`. However, not all imported packages are used throughout the file.

## Impact

Unused imports increase clutter and may reduce the readability of the code. This unnecessary inclusion makes code maintenance harder and can lead to confusion in larger codebases. Severity: **low**.

## Location

Top of the file, in the `import` block.

## Code Issue

```go
import (
    "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-timeouts/resource/timeouts"
    "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/types"
    "github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/helpers"
)
```

## Fix

Only import the packages being used:
```go
import (
    "github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/helpers"
)
```
