# Title

Use of Unnecessary Import: "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-timeouts/resource/timeouts"

##

Path to the file:
`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/models.go`

## Problem

The `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-timeouts/resource/timeouts` package is imported in the file, but it is only used for defining the `Timeouts` field in the `ManagedEnvironmentResourceModel`. This usage may not justify importing a complete package unless the field performs additional runtime-meaningful logic.

## Impact

- Introduces unnecessary dependency overhead.
- Can make code maintenance harder by inflating dependencies.
- Low-level readability concerns as it looks like over-engineering.

**Severity: Low**

## Location

```go
import (
	"github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-timeouts/resource/timeouts"
)
```

## Code Issue

```go
Timeouts timeouts.Value `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
```

## Fix

Replace `timeouts.Value` with a simpler type like `types.String` if advanced timeout handling is not needed.

```go
import (
	// Remove unused timeouts
	"github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/types"
)

type ManagedEnvironmentResourceModel struct {
	Timeouts types.String `tfsdk:"timeouts"` // Adjust the type's design
	Id       types.String `tfsdk:"id"`
	// remaining fields
}
```
