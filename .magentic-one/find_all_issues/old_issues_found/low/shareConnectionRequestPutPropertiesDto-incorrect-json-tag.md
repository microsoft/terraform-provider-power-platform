# Title

Inconsistent JSON tag for `NotifyShareTargetOption`

## Path

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connection/dto.go

## Problem

The field `NotifyShareTargetOption` in `shareConnectionRequestPutPropertiesDto` has inconsistent capitalization in its JSON tag, using lowerCamelCase (`"notifyShareTargetOption"`). Other fields across the file use PascalCase. Consistency in naming conventions is crucial for avoiding integration problems.

## Impact

The discrepancy may cause issues in integration with external systems or APIs that expect PascalCase naming. Severity is low since this primarily affects maintainability and convention adherence rather than functionality.

## Location

```go
shareConnectionRequestPutPropertiesDto struct {
    NotifyShareTargetOption string `json:"notifyShareTargetOption"`
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
NotifyShareTargetOption string `json:"notifyShareTargetOption"`
```

## Fix

Adopt consistent naming conventions by changing the JSON tag to PascalCase:

```go
NotifyShareTargetOption string `json:"NotifyShareTargetOption"`
```

Alternatively, confirm alignment with lowerCamelCase if that is preferred across the project and update other tags to match.
