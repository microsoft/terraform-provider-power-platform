# Title

Missing Comments in Function Header

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/customtypes/uuid.go

## Problem

The function `NewUUIDNull` lacks descriptive comments explaining its purpose, its input, or its output. Having comments at the function header level is critical for maintaining readability and understanding of the codebase.

## Impact

When developers or contributors read through the code later, they may face confusion regarding the role of this function, leading to wasted time trying to decipher its functionality from context. The severity is **low** since it does not affect the functionality.

## Location

Function declaration: `NewUUIDNull`

## Code Issue

```go
func NewUUIDNull() UUID {
	return UUID{
		StringValue: basetypes.NewStringNull(),
	}
}
```

## Fix

Add a meaningful comment block above the function to describe its functionality.

```go
// NewUUIDNull creates a UUID object with a null string value.
// It returns an empty UUID representation using basetypes.NewStringNull.
func NewUUIDNull() UUID {
	return UUID{
		StringValue: basetypes.NewStringNull(),
	}
}
```
