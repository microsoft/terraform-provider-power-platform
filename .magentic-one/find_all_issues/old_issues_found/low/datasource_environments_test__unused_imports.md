# Issue 3: Unused Imports in the File

## Path

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/datasource_environments_test.go`

## Problem

Imports such as `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/tfjsonpath` and `github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/helpers` seem unused in this file. Unused imports add unnecessary clutter and increase cognitive load.

## Impact

Unused imports increase the file's complexity, reduce readability, and complicate maintenance. It may also slow down the compile time as the compiler processes unutilized modules. Severity: **Low**.

## Location

Occurs in the import block at the top of the file.

### Code Issue Example

```go
import (
	"net/http"
	"regexp"
	"testing"

	"github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/tfjsonpath"
	"github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/helpers"
)
```

### Fix

Remove the unused imports:

```go
import (
	"net/http"
	"regexp"
	"testing"

	"github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/helper/resource"
	"github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/knownvalue"
	"github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/statecheck"
	"github.com/jarcoal/httpmock"
	"github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/mocks"
)
```

Use a linter, such as `goimports` or `golangci-lint`, to identify unused imports automatically.
