# Title

Incorrect Variable Name `dvExits`

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_settings/datasource_environment_settings.go

## Problem

The variable name `dvExits` is misleading as it suggests "Dataverse Exits" rather than "Dataverse Exists," which may confuse readers or maintainers of the code.

## Impact

Poor naming conventions harm code readability and contribute to misinterpretation. Severity is low, as it does not affect the operation of the code.

## Location

```go
	dvExits, err := d.EnvironmentSettingsClient.DataverseExists(ctx, state.EnvironmentId.ValueString())
```

## Code Issue

The variable `dvExits`:

```go
	dvExits, err := d.EnvironmentSettingsClient.DataverseExists(ctx, state.EnvironmentId.ValueString())
```

## Fix

Rename the variable to `dataverseExists`, which accurately reflects its purpose.

```go
	dataverseExists, err := d.EnvironmentSettingsClient.DataverseExists(ctx, state.EnvironmentId.ValueString())
```
