# Title

Missing Diagnostic Handling for Configuration Validation

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution_checker_rules/datasource_solution_checker_rules.go

## Problem

In the `Configure` method, there is no diagnostic handling for the edge case where `req.ProviderData` is `nil` (automatic validation check). While the current logic ensures that no action is taken for `nil` data, it misses diagnostic feedback to inform users of this behavior during the configuration validation phase.

## Impact

- **Severity**: Low
Although this does not currently cause runtime errors, providing diagnostics for skipped configuration validation improves transparency for users and complements the documentation for the provider.

## Location

This issue pertains to the `Configure` method in the following block:

## Code Issue

```go
if req.ProviderData == nil {
	// ProviderData will be null when Configure is called from ValidateConfig. It's ok.
	return
}
```

## Fix

Enhance the `Configure` logic by adding diagnostic feedback to inform users that no action was taken due to `nil` `ProviderData`. This can be achieved by appending a non-error message to the diagnostics.

```go
if req.ProviderData == nil {
	resp.Diagnostics.AddWarning(
		"Provider Configuration Skipped",
		"The provider configuration was skipped because the incoming data was nil. This is a normal operation during validation.",
	)
	return
}
```

This resolution ensures users are informed of the behavior, improving transparency without raising unnecessary errors.
