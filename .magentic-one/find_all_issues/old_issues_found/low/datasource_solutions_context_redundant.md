# Title

Redundant Context Reassignment in Multiple Functions

##

Path: `/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution/datasource_solutions.go`

## Problem

In many functions (e.g., `Metadata`, `Schema`, `Configure`, `Read`), the `ctx` variable is passed through the `helpers.EnterRequestContext` method, which is unnecessary unless the context is explicitly updated or contains vital data modifications in workflow. As it stands, its usage appears redundant. The code does not handle nor explicitly check for changes in the `ctx`.

## Impact

This redundancy makes the code more complex without adding functionality. Reassigning and exiting the context adds overhead and potential confusion for developers, potentially leading to bugs if the `ctx` implementation changes in the future. Severity is medium because it affects readability and long-term stability.

## Location

Functions such as `Metadata`, `Schema`, `Configure`, and `Read`.

## Code Issue

```go
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, d.TypeInfo, req)
defer exitContext()
```

## Fix

Unless critical context modifications are actually happening inside `helpers.EnterRequestContext`, replace this with direct usage of the `ctx` variable.

```go
// Suggest using ctx directly unless modifications are explicit
defer helpers.ExitRequestContext(ctx, d.TypeInfo, req)
```
