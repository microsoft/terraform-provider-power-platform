# Title

Repeated Import of 'regexp' with No Usage

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/validators/make_field_required_when_other_field_does_not_have_value.go

## Problem

The file imports the `regexp` package, but the imported module is not utilized anywhere within the code snippet provided. The redundant import increases the file size unnecessarily and causes code complexity without serving its purpose.

## Impact

Unused imports:
- Increase the program's memory footprint.
- Compromise readability and maintainability for new developers joining the project.
- May cause confusion for the team, thinking it serves an invisible purpose. Severity is **low**.

## Location

Look in the imports section:

```go
import (
	"regexp"

	"github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/path"
	"github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/schema/validator"
)
```

## Code Issue

```go
	"regexp"
```

## Fix

To fix this redundancy issue, the unused package import should be removed, unless it is utilized later within the file. Refactor the imports block to exclude "regexp".

```go
import (
	"github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/path"
	"github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/schema/validator"
)
```
