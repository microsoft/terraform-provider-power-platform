# Title

Lack of Grouping and Documentation for Related Constants

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/constants/constants.go

## Problem

The file contains a significant number of constants organized in a scattered manner without grouping them under logical packages or providing proper documentation. While the constants are grouped by region (e.g., `PUBLIC_*` vs. `USDOD_*`), there are cases where related constants that might share the same function are listed without appropriate categorization or separation using comments.

## Impact

This lack of organization can make it difficult to navigate the file, especially for new developers. It also increases the likelihood of introducing errors when maintaining or enhancing the codebase. Severity: Low.

## Location

The overall structure of the file and sections such as:

```go
const (
    PUBLIC_ADMIN_POWER_PLATFORM_URL     = "api.admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com"
    PUBLIC_OAUTH_AUTHORITY_URL          = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/"
    PUBLIC_BAPI_DOMAIN                  = "api.bap.microsoft.com"
    PUBLIC_POWERAPPS_API_DOMAIN         = "api.powerapps.com"
    PUBLIC_POWERAPPS_SCOPE              = "https://service.powerapps.com/.default"
    PUBLIC_POWERPLATFORM_API_DOMAIN     = "api.powerplatform.com"
    PUBLIC_POWERPLATFORM_API_SCOPE      = "https://api.powerplatform.com/.default"
    PUBLIC_LICENSING_API_DOMAIN         = "licensing.powerplatform.microsoft.com"
    PUBLIC_POWERAPPS_ADVISOR_API_DOMAIN = "api.advisor.powerapps.com"
    PUBLIC_POWERAPPS_ADVISOR_API_SCOPE  = "https://advisor.powerapps.com/.default"
    PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_SCOPE              = "https://adminanalytics.powerplatform.microsoft.com/.default"
)
```

## Code Issue

Scattered constants in multiple regions without higher-level organization or documentation.

## Fix

Introduce logical groupings using namespaces or additional comments to improve clarity. Here's an example of grouping public-related constants under a structure, along with comments:

```go
// Public cloud constants relevant to Power Platform API and scope definitions
const (
    PUBLIC_ADMIN_POWER_PLATFORM_URL     = "api.admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com"
    PUBLIC_OAUTH_AUTHORITY_URL          = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/"
    PUBLIC_BAPI_DOMAIN                  = "api.bap.microsoft.com"
    PUBLIC_POWERAPPS_API_DOMAIN         = "api.powerapps.com"
    PUBLIC_POWERAPPS_SCOPE              = "https://service.powerapps.com/.default"
    PUBLIC_POWERPLATFORM_API_DOMAIN     = "api.powerplatform.com"
    PUBLIC_POWERPLATFORM_API_SCOPE      = "https://api.powerplatform.com/.default"
    PUBLIC_LICENSING_API_DOMAIN         = "licensing.powerplatform.microsoft.com"
    PUBLIC_POWERAPPS_ADVISOR_API_DOMAIN = "api.advisor.powerapps.com"
    PUBLIC_POWERAPPS_ADVISOR_API_SCOPE  = "https://advisor.powerapps.com/.default"
    PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_SCOPE              = "https://adminanalytics.powerplatform.microsoft.com/.default"
)
```

Additionally, where applicable, consider moving region-specific constants to separate files or packages, based on the regional grouping (e.g., public, USGOV, CHINA).
