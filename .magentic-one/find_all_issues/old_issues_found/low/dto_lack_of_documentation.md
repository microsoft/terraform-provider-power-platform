# Title

Lack of Comments and Documentation

## 

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/copilot_studio_application_insights/dto.go

## Problem

The provided file lacks comments and comprehensive documentation for its structs and fields. While Go is a language that promotes simplicity, the absence of comments makes it challenging for developers to understand:
1. The purpose of each field.
2. Appropriate use cases for the structs.
3. Any domain-specific significance (e.g., how `AppInsightsConnectionString` is supposed to be used).

This lack of comments also limits the readability and maintainability of the code.

## Impact

- **Low severity**:
   - Slows down onboarding for new developers.
   - Requires developers to investigate familiar usage from other parts of the codebase.
   - Risks misuse of fields due to unclear semantics.

## Location

All structs in the file.

## Code Issue

For example:
```go
type CopilotStudioAppInsightsDto struct {
	EnvironmentId               string `json:"environmentId"`
	BotId                       string `json:"botId"`
	AppInsightsConnectionString string `json:"appInsightsConnectionString"`
	IncludeSensitiveInformation bool   `json:"includeSensitiveInformation"`
	IncludeActivities           bool   `json:"includeActivities"`
	IncludeActions              bool   `json:"includeActions"`
	Errors                      string `json:"errors"`
	NetworkIsolation            string `json:"networkIsolation"`
}
```

## Fix

Add comments to document each struct and field describing its purpose, constraints, and usage. Below is an example fix for the `CopilotStudioAppInsightsDto`.

```go
// CopilotStudioAppInsightsDto represents the configuration data needed for 
// connecting and managing application insights for Copilot Studio.
//
// Fields:
// - EnvironmentId: A unique identifier for the deployment environment.
// - BotId: Identifier for the bot associated with the studio.
// - AppInsightsConnectionString: A connection string for linking with the application insights service.
// - IncludeSensitiveInformation: Whether sensitive information should be included in logs.
// - IncludeActivities: Indicates if activities should be logged.
// - IncludeActions: Indicates if actions should be logged.
// - Errors: Field to capture error-related description.
// - NetworkIsolation: Describes network isolation configuration (e.g., isolated or non-isolated).
type CopilotStudioAppInsightsDto struct {
	EnvironmentId               string `json:"environmentId"` 
	BotId                       string `json:"botId"` 
	AppInsightsConnectionString string `json:"appInsightsConnectionString"` 
	IncludeSensitiveInformation bool   `json:"includeSensitiveInformation"` 
	IncludeActivities           bool   `json:"includeActivities"` 
	IncludeActions              bool   `json:"includeActions"` 
	Errors                      string `json:"errors"` 
	NetworkIsolation            string `json:"networkIsolation"` 
}
```
This drastically increases readability and maintainability of the code.
