# Low Severity Issue - Redundant Environment Retrieval in Resource Creation

## Problem

In the `Create` method, the environments associated with the billing policy are retrieved twice â€” once before adding the environments to the policy (`GetEnvironmentsForBillingPolicy`) and once again after the addition. This redundant call is unnecessary as the second retrieval doesn't significantly contribute to the logic flow.

## Impact

### Severity: Low

- **Performance impact**: Redundant API calls consume unnecessary resources and introduce latency without adding value.
- **Complexity**: Adds additional logic that isn't essential to achieving the intended operation.

## Location

File: `/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/resource_billing_policy_environment.go`

### Code Example

```go
environments, err := r.LicensingClient.GetEnvironmentsForBillingPolicy(ctx, plan.BillingPolicyId)
if err != nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(fmt.Sprintf("Client error when updating %s", r.FullTypeName()), err.Error())
    return
}

// Redundant environments retrieval after addition
environments, err = r.LicensingClient.GetEnvironmentsForBillingPolicy(ctx, plan.BillingPolicyId)
if err != nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(fmt.Sprintf("Client error when updating %s", r.FullTypeName()), err.Error())
    return
}
```

## Suggested Fix

Remove the redundant call to `GetEnvironmentsForBillingPolicy` after adding environments to the billing policy.

### Fix Example

```go
environments, err := r.LicensingClient.GetEnvironmentsForBillingPolicy(ctx, plan.BillingPolicyId)
if err != nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(fmt.Sprintf("Client error when updating %s", r.FullTypeName()), err.Error())
    return
}

// Second retrieval removed as it is unnecessary
plan.Environments = environments
```

### Benefits of Fix

- **Improved performance**: Removes an unnecessary API call, reducing resource consumption and execution time.
- **Simplified code**: Eliminates redundant logic, making the function easier to read and maintain.
