# Title

Unutilized Struct Field

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_templates/models.go

## Problem

The `EnvironmentTemplatesDataSource` struct contains a field named `EnvironmentTemplatesClient`, which is declared but not utilized within the code. This can lead to confusion and implies unused resource or potential dead code.

## Impact

The presence of unused struct fields increases complexity without adding value. This issue has a severity of "low" because it impacts readability and maintainability of the code but does not cause any runtime errors.

## Location

Line 12: Definition of `EnvironmentTemplatesDataSource` struct.

## Code Issue

```go

type EnvironmentTemplatesDataSource struct {
    helpers.TypeInfo
    EnvironmentTemplatesClient client
}

```

## Fix

Remove the unused `EnvironmentTemplatesClient` field from the struct or find a valid use for it, ensuring it aligns with the required functionality.

```go

type EnvironmentTemplatesDataSource struct {
    helpers.TypeInfo
}

```
