# Title

Improper nesting and lack of comments in struct definitions.

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/languages/dto.go`

## Problem

The struct `languagesArrayDto` contains a poorly defined field `Value` which itself references another struct type `languageDto`. However, there is no inline documentation explaining the relationship between these DTOs or the context for a `Value` array. Furthermore, critical fields like `localeId` or `name` lack semantic comments to clarify their purpose.

## Impact

- Developers working with this code might struggle to understand the intent of the DTOs, especially when integrating or extending this service.
- Lack of comments increases coupling and decreases maintainability.
- Poor readability may slow down development velocity and lead to misinterpretation of the code.

Severity: **Low**

## Location

Struct definitions in the following locations:
1. `languagesArrayDto` definition
2. `languageDto` definition

## Code Issue

```go
type languagesArrayDto struct {
	Value []languageDto `json:"value"`
}

type languageDto struct {
	Name       string                `json:"name"`
	ID         string                `json:"id"`
	Type       string                `json:"type"`
	Properties languagePropertiesDto `json:"properties"`
}
```

## Fix

Refactor the code with clear, inline comments describing the purpose of each struct and its fields:

```go
// languagesArrayDto represents an array of supported language configurations.
// Each language is defined by the `languageDto` struct.
type languagesArrayDto struct {
	// Value contains the list of languages available in the service.
	Value []languageDto `json:"value"`
}

// languageDto represents a single language configuration,
// including its ID, name, and additional properties.
type languageDto struct {
	// Name specifies the name of the language in string format.
	Name string `json:"name"`
	// ID is the unique identifier for the language.
	ID string `json:"id"`
	// Type indicates the type/category of the language (e.g., text, audio, etc.).
	Type string `json:"type"`
	// Properties provide a set of key-value descriptions for additional metadata of the language.
	Properties languagePropertiesDto `json:"properties"`
}
```

Implementing these comments helps with code readability and provides crucial information to other developers working on this service. While it does not directly impact runtime, better documentation is key to maintainable and scalable codebases.
