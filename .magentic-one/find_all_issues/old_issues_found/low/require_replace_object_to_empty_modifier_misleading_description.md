# Title  
Possible Misleading Description in `Description` Method  

## Path to the file  
`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/modifiers/require_replace_object_to_empty_modifier.go`  

## Problem  
The `Description` method returns a string explaining the behavior of the modifier, but its wording might be misleading. Specifically, the description states:  

```text  
Ensures that change to empty attribute value will force a replace when changed.  
```  

This does not specify the exact conditions under which a replacement is triggered. It could confuse developers regarding whether the behavior applies when both StateValue and PlanValue are null, or only when PlanValue transitions to null.  

## Impact  
Misleading or unclear documentation can result in developers misusing the modifier or misunderstanding its functionality, which could lead to incorrect applications or debugging difficulties.  

### Severity: Low  

## Location  
The issue resides in the `Description` method:  

## Code Issue  

```go
func (d *requireReplaceObjectToEmptyModifier) Description(ctx context.Context) string {
	return "Ensures that change to empty attribute value will force a replace when changed."
}
```  

## Fix  

Ensure the description accurately reflects the modifier's behavior.  

```go
func (d *requireReplaceObjectToEmptyModifier) Description(ctx context.Context) string {
	return "Forces replacement when an object, initially non-empty, is modified to be empty."
}
```  

This updated description better clarifies the conditions that trigger replacement, improving readability and correctness.
