# Title

Missing Comments in Function Header

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/customtypes/uuid.go

## Problem

The function `NewUUIDUnknown` lacks descriptive comments that explain the purpose of this function, its inputs, or outputs. This absence compromises code readability and clarity for other developers.

## Impact

Developers may require more time and effort to understand the utility of this function during future code reviews or debugging. While this does not affect runtime behavior, the issue's severity is **low** as it impacts overall maintainability.

## Location

Function declaration: `NewUUIDUnknown`

## Code Issue

```go
func NewUUIDUnknown() UUID {
	return UUID{
		StringValue: basetypes.NewStringUnknown(),
	}
}
```

## Fix

Introduce a concise and clear comment that states the function's purpose and behavior.

```go
// NewUUIDUnknown creates a UUID object with an unknown string value.
// It returns a UUID representation using basetypes.NewStringUnknown.
func NewUUIDUnknown() UUID {
	return UUID{
		StringValue: basetypes.NewStringUnknown(),
	}
}
```
