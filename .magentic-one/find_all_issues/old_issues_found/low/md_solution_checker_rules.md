# Title
**Limited Context for Machine Readability**

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/md_solution_checker_rules.go`

## Problem

The file is primarily focused on defining a long markdown string and does not provide any machine-readable structure or mechanisms for validation. As a result, this Markdown document cannot be programmatically parsed or queried without considerable processing overhead.

## Impact

- **Severity:** Low
- This issue is **low severity** because the fileâ€™s focus is documentation. However, extending its function to be machine-readable could enhance usability for automated tools.
- Projects leveraging this constant for automation or validation will face additional complexity, potentially leading to defects or errors caused by brittle manual parsing.

## Location

```go
const SolutionCheckerMarkdown = `
# Solution Checker Rules
...
`
```

### Suggestion

Convert the content into structured data (e.g. JSON, YAML, or TOML) or provide both Markdown and machine-readable formats. For example:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "code": "meta-remove-dup-reg",
      "description": "Checks for duplicate Dataverse plug-in registrations",
      "guidance_url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/data-platform/best-practices/business-logic/do-not-duplicate-plugin-step-registration"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Benefits:
- Supports integration with parsing libraries.
- Simplifies validation or automated report generation.
