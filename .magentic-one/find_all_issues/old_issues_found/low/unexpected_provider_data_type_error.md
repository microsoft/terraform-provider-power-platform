# Title

Unexpected ProviderData Type error lacks detailed handling

## 

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/datasource_billing_policies.go`

## Problem

The `Configure` method in `BillingPoliciesDataSource` generates an error when `req.ProviderData` is of an unexpected type. However, this error could be made more robust by detailing what actions the user or developer should take to resolve it.

## Impact

Without sufficient error details, debugging becomes more challenging, particularly if the issue recurs. This may hinder debugging efforts, especially in production environments. Severity: **Low**

## Location

`Configure` method in `BillingPoliciesDataSource` implementation.

## Code Issue

```go
if !ok {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
        fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
    )
    return
}
```

## Fix

Update the error message to provide suggestions on verifying or resolving the issue.

```go
if !ok {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
        fmt.Sprintf(
            "Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Ensure that the provider is correctly configured, "+
            "and the ProviderData includes the correct API client. If the issue persists, contact the provider developers.",
            req.ProviderData,
        ),
    )
    return
}
```
