# Title

Use of outdated `math/rand/v2` package

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/datasource_billing_policies_test.go

## Problem

The code imports the package `math/rand/v2`. This is not a standard library package, and it causes potential incompatibility or confusion with other modules. The Go standard library provides a well-supported `math/rand` package, which should be used instead.

## Impact

Using a non-standard library package can lead to maintenance issues and compatibility errors in future Go versions or dependencies. This is considered low severity since it currently functions but can degrade maintainability.

## Location

Found in the imports section of the file:

```go
import (
	"math/rand/v2"
	"net/http"
	"regexp"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
	"testing"
    
    ...
)
```

## Code Issue

```go
import (
	"math/rand/v2"
)
```

## Fix

Replace `math/rand/v2` with `math/rand` from the Go standard library.

```go
import (
	"math/rand"
)
```

Explanation:

Switching to the standard library makes the code more reliable and compatible with other Go modules, adhering to Go's best practices.
