### 3. Title
Redundant Regular Expression for `StringRegex`

##  
`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/helpers/regex.go`  

## Problem  
The `StringRegex` constant is defined as `".*"` and matches any string. However, this regex is redundant, as it essentially matches any input without exception. If used in validation, its inclusion is unnecessary and could indicate design errors or misunderstandings about its usage.  

## Impact  
Misleading usage of this regex could lead to poor code readability and questions about its necessity. Severity: **low**.  

## Location  
```go
const (  
	StringRegex = "^.*$"  
)  
```  

## Fix  
Remove the `StringRegex` constant if it's unnecessary, or clarify its purpose with comments. For example:  

```go
const (  
	// Matches any string (use sparingly and only with clear intent).
	StringRegex = "^.*$"  
)  
```
