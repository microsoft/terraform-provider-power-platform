# Title

Unnecessary Activation/Deactivation of `httpmock` in `TestUnitTenantApplicationPackagesDataSource_Validate_Filter`

## File Path

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/datasource_tenant_application_packages_test.go`

## Problem

The `httpmock.Activate()` and `httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()` are used unnecessarily in the function `TestUnitTenantApplicationPackagesDataSource_Validate_Filter`. These functions are redundant if `httpmock` is not utilized within this test case. 

## Impact

Including unnecessary activations and deactivations for `httpmock` adds to the complexity and maintenance of the codebase. It can also marginally affect test execution time by triggering operations that aren't required. It makes the code harder to debug and read.

**Severity: Low**

## Location

Function `TestUnitTenantApplicationPackagesDataSource_Validate_Filter`, surrounding unnecessary `httpmock` calls.

## Code Issue

```go
httpmock.Activate()
defer httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
```

## Fix

Ensure `httpmock` is only activated and deactivated when it is explicitly required to mock HTTP calls. Since no direct `httpmock` usage seems evident in this test case, these lines should be removed, as shown:

```go
// Remove the unnecessary httpmock.Activate() lines
// Remove defer httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
```

This cleans up the code for improved clarity and performance.
