# Title

Lack of Error Interface Implementation Validation

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/customerrors/unexpected_http_status_code_error.go`

## Problem

The `UnexpectedHttpStatusCodeError` struct declares that it implements the `error` interface using the `_ error = UnexpectedHttpStatusCodeError{}` statement. However, this validation is unnecessary and does not convey additional meaning. It could lead to confusion in interpreting the code. Go indirectly ensures struct compliance with interfaces by the presence of the `Error` method if the type is used as an `error`.

## Impact

This statement adds unnecessary code that serves no functional purpose. It may confuse future developers unfamiliar with this syntax and provide no runtime or compile-time benefit beyond what Go does natively. Severity is **low**.

## Location

Line: `var _ error = UnexpectedHttpStatusCodeError{}`

## Code Issue

```go
var _ error = UnexpectedHttpStatusCodeError{}
```

## Fix

Remove the `_ error = UnexpectedHttpStatusCodeError{}` line to simplify the code and avoid redundancy.

```go
// Remove this line; it is redundant and unnecessary:
// var _ error = UnexpectedHttpStatusCodeError{}
```
