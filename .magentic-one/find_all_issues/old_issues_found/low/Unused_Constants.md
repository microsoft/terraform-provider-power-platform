# Title

Unused Constants: `ReleaseCycleFirstReleasePublicDto` and `ReleaseCycleFirstReleaseGovDto`

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/dto.go`

## Problem

Certain constants, such as `ReleaseCycleFirstReleasePublicDto` and `ReleaseCycleFirstReleaseGovDto`, are defined but are not used anywhere in the code. This leads to unnecessary clutter.

## Impact

Unused constants increase the cognitive load on developers and reduce code maintainability. Large codebases suffer from being harder to navigate if unused elements are not removed.

**Severity:** Low

## Location

In the constants section, the following definitions are unused:

## Code Issue

```go
const (
    ReleaseCycleFirstReleasePublicDto = "FirstRelease"
    ReleaseCycleFirstReleaseGovDto    = "GovFR"
)
```

## Fix

Remove the unused constants if there is no plan to use them in future code.

```go
// Removed ReleaseCycleFirstReleasePublicDto and ReleaseCycleFirstReleaseGovDto from the constants section
```
