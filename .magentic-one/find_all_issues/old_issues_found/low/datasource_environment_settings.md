# Title

Misleading Error Message for Empty `EnvironmentId`

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_settings/datasource_environment_settings.go

## Problem

The error message for an empty `environment_id` in the `Read` function is not clear or helpful. It redundantly states "environment_id cannot be an empty string" twice, without providing additional context or corrective guidance.

## Impact

Poor error communication negatively impacts developer experience and troubleshooting efficiency. The severity is low, as this does not directly affect runtime functionality.

## Location

Line located within the `Read` function:

```go
	if state.EnvironmentId.ValueString() == "" {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError("environment_id cannot be an empty string", "environment_id cannot be an empty string")
		return
	}
```

## Code Issue

The redundant error message is defined as:

```go
	resp.Diagnostics.AddError("environment_id cannot be an empty string", "environment_id cannot be an empty string")
```

## Fix

Modify the error message to be more descriptive and remove redundancy.

```go
	resp.Diagnostics.AddError("Invalid Input", "The 'environment_id' parameter is required and cannot be left empty. Please verify and provide a valid GUID.")
```
