# Title

Unused PowerPagesSettingsDto type

## Path

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/tenant_settings/dto.go

## Problem

The definition of the `PowerPagesSettingsDto` struct:

```go
type powerPagesSettingsDto struct {
}
```

is empty and unutilized. Typically, data transfer objects (DTOs) are expected to contain fields that serve as a bridge between data models and various data processing modules.

## Impact

Leaving it as is conveys unclear intent regarding its employment in the design. It increases code clutter, detracts visual cleanness, and becomes a potential source of confusion.

## Location

Line: `type powerPagesSettingsDto struct {}` found in /workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/tenant_settings/dto.go

## Fix

Consider removing the `powerPagesSettingsDto` struct if it serves no purpose, or populate it with necessary fields to align with its intended functionality.

```go
// If the DTO is redundant:
// Remove the DTO entirely

// If the DTO is needed:
type powerPagesSettingsDto struct {
    ExampleField string `json:"exampleField,omitempty"`
}
```
