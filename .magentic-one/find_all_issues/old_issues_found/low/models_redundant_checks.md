# Title

Redundant Checks in `convertCreateEnvironmentDtoFromSourceModel`

## Path

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/models.go`

## Problem

In the `convertCreateEnvironmentDtoFromSourceModel` function, there are multiple redundant checks such as this pattern:

```go
if !environmentSource.Description.IsNull() && environmentSource.Description.ValueString() != "" {
	environmentDto.Properties.Description = environmentSource.Description.ValueString()
}
```

The snippet above checks both `IsNull` and `ValueString() != ""`, which may be unnecessary since a `null` string will typically either be empty or invalid.

## Impact

- Reduces code efficiency with unnecessary checks.
- Overcomplicates the logic, which could create confusion for developers.
- Severity: Low.

## Location

Within the `convertCreateEnvironmentDtoFromSourceModel` function.

## Code Issue

```go
if !environmentSource.Description.IsNull() && environmentSource.Description.ValueString() != "" {
	environmentDto.Properties.Description = environmentSource.Description.ValueString()
}
```

## Fix

Optimize the check by removing redundancy.

```go
if description := environmentSource.Description.ValueString(); description != "" {
	environmentDto.Properties.Description = description
}
```
