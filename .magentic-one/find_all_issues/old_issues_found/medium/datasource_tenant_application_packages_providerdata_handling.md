# Title

Improper Handling of Uninitialized `ProviderData`

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/datasource_tenant_application_packages.go`

## Problem

In the `Configure` method, the `ProviderData` is checked for `nil`, but there is no diagnostic message indicating this is an intentional omission of configuration validation. Although this behavior is currently documented in the code comment, proper diagnostics should be added to improve transparency and debugging for users.

## Impact

This may confuse developers or maintainers, especially when unexpected behavior arises due to `ProviderData` being `nil`. Severity: **medium**.

## Location

The `Configure` method where the `if req.ProviderData == nil` condition is checked:

## Code Issue

```go
if req.ProviderData == nil {
    // ProviderData will be null when Configure is called from ValidateConfig. It's ok.
    return
}
```

## Fix

Add diagnostic messages indicating the intentional omission of configuration validation when `ProviderData` is `nil`.

```go
if req.ProviderData == nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddWarning(
        "ProviderData Not Initialized",
        "ProviderData is nil. This is expected when Configure is called from ValidateConfig. No action required.",
    )
    return
}
```
