# Title

Improper Function Naming Convention

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/mocks/mocks.go

## Problem

The function `TestsEntraLicesingGroupName()` does not adhere to conventional Go naming practices. Function names should be written in mixed case with no under_scores and ideally follow camel case or Pascal case conventions. 

## Impact

This naming issue violates Go's conventions, potentially causing confusion for developers reviewing or maintaining the code. Furthermore, the name is misspelled, as "Licesing" is likely meant to be "Licensing." The severity of this issue is medium.

## Location

Line 18 of the file `/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/mocks/mocks.go`.

## Code Issue

```go
func TestsEntraLicesingGroupName() string {
	return "pptestusers"
}
```

## Fix

Change the function name to adhere to Go conventions and correct the spelling mistake:

```go
func TestEntraLicensingGroupName() string {
	return "pptestusers"
}
```

This change makes the function name reflect proper spelling and follow Go naming conventions. The intent of the function remains clear and readable.
