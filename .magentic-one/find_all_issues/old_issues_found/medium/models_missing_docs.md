# Title

Missing Interface Documentation

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_groups/models.go

## Problem

The `EnvironmentGroupResource` struct is missing a brief documentation comment explaining its purpose. Likewise, the details for data structures like `EnvironmentGroupResourceModel` are absent.

## Impact

This lack of documentation makes it difficult for developers to understand the purpose of the struct quickly. It could lead to maintainability issues and slower onboarding for new team members.

Severity: medium

## Location

Struct Definition

```go
type EnvironmentGroupResource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	EnvironmentGroupClient client
}
```

## Code Issue

The issue relates to the absence of any comment block specifying intention or origin.

## Fix

```go
// EnvironmentGroupResource represents the resource entity for environment grouping.
// It inherits TypeInfo from helpers and uses the EnvironmentGroupClient client interface.
type EnvironmentGroupResource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	EnvironmentGroupClient client
}
```
