# Title

Hardcoded values for certain parameters (e.g., environmentFilter.Type)

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_group_rule_set/dto.go

## Problem

Hardcoded values like `dto.EnvironmentFilter.Type = "Include"` within the `convertEnvironmentGroupRuleSetResourceModelToDto` function can reduce flexibility and adaptability of the code over time. If new types are introduced or changes are required, modifications might need to be applied throughout the codebase.

## Impact

- Limits flexibility of extending the code.
- Risks introducing bugs when hardcoded values are used in multiple places as any change requires careful updates.
- Reduces readability and maintainability.

Severity: Medium

## Location

Function `convertEnvironmentGroupRuleSetResourceModelToDto`.

## Code Issue

```go
dto.EnvironmentFilter.Type = "Include"
```

## Fix

Refactor the hardcoded values into constants or configuration defaults. This approach makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain.

```go
const defaultEnvironmentFilterType = "Include"

// Update assignment in function
dto.EnvironmentFilter.Type = defaultEnvironmentFilterType
```

This ensures that the value is centralized and can be adjusted in future without changes across the whole codebase.
