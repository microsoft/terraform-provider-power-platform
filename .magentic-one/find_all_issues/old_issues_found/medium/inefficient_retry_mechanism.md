# Title

Inefficient Retry Mechanism in Execute Method.

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/api/client.go

## Problem

The retry mechanism in the `Execute` method is suboptimal:
- Excessive reliance on static sleep creates unnecessary delays, especially in dynamic environments.
- The method does not account for exponential backoff strategies to optimize retry logic.

## Impact

Without a proper exponential backoff, the retry mechanism can become resource-intensive and hinder performance, especially under high load. This is particularly impactful for API calls subject to rate-limiting policies.

Severity: **Medium**

## Location

Retry logic within the `Execute` method:

```go
waitFor := retryAfter(ctx, resp.HttpResponse)
err = client.SleepWithContext(ctx, waitFor)
if err != nil {
    return resp, err
}
```

## Code Issue

Retries rely heavily on uniform sleep durations without considering network or server conditions dynamically.

```go
waitFor := retryAfter(ctx, resp.HttpResponse)
err = client.SleepWithContext(ctx, waitFor)
if err != nil {
    return resp, err
}
```

## Fix

Implement an exponential backoff strategy with jitter to optimize retry logic.

```go
retryCount := 0
maxRetries := 5
baseDelay := time.Second

for retryCount < maxRetries {
    waitFor := baseDelay * (1 << retryCount) // Exponential backoff
    jitter := time.Duration(rand.Intn(200)) * time.Millisecond
    waitFor += jitter

    err = client.SleepWithContext(ctx, waitFor)
    if err != nil {
        return resp, err
    }
    retryCount++
}
```

This fix ensures:
- Reduced strain on resources.
- Dynamic adjustments to retry delay based on an exponential backoff strategy.
