# Title

Incorrect Error Message Handling in `Validate` Function

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/validators/make_field_required_when_other_field_does_not_have_value_validator.go`

## Problem

In the `Validate` method, the error diagnostic message provided when the `paths` length is not equal to 1 contains only a generic error description. However, it lacks context or detailed information explaining the issue to the user. This makes troubleshooting difficult during implementation.

## Impact

Providing a generic error message impacts user experience negatively:
- It can confuse developers during debugging.
- Leaves ambiguity regarding the root cause of the issue.

Severity: Medium

## Location

File: `make_field_required_when_other_field_does_not_have_value_validator.go`

Function: `Validate`

## Code Issue

The following code snippet demonstrates the issue:

```go
if paths == nil && len(paths) != 1 {
	res.Diagnostics.AddError("Other field required when value of validator should have exactly one match", "")
	return
}
```

## Fix

The error message should be more descriptive, providing clear guidance on the issue and potential solutions:

```go
if paths == nil || len(paths) != 1 {
	res.Diagnostics.AddError(
		"Validation Error",
		fmt.Sprintf("Expected exactly one match for expression '%v', but found %d matches. Check configuration and ensure this expression maps to one field.", av.OtherFieldExpression, len(paths)),
	)
	return
}
```

Explanation:
- The updated error message includes details about the `av.OtherFieldExpression` and the actual count of matches (`len(paths)`).
- Provides actionable insight for resolving the problem, making debugging more straightforward.
