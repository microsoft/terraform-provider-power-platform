# Title

Inconsistent Empty String Assignments for Constants

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/constants/constants.go

## Problem

Several constants, such as `CHINA_ANALYTICS_SCOPE`, `EX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE`, and `RX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE`, are defined with empty string values (`""`). It is unclear whether these values are placeholders, defaults, or intentional omissions due to lack of information.

## Impact

Empty string assignments without a clear explanation can lead to confusion among developers, especially when debugging issues related to these constants. If external integrations depend on these values, undefined behavior may occur. Severity: Medium.

## Location

Example problematic lines:

```go
const (
    CHINA_ANALYTICS_SCOPE = ""
    EX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE    = ""
    RX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE    = ""
)
```

## Code Issue

Here is the scenario:

```go
const CHINA_ANALYTICS_SCOPE = ""
const EX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE = ""
const RX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE = ""
```

## Fix

Provide meaningful defaults or add comments indicating why these values are empty. This ensures that future developers understand the reason behind the empty values and can take appropriate action if required.

```go
// CHINA_ANALYTICS_SCOPE is intentionally left blank due to unavailability of analytics scope
const CHINA_ANALYTICS_SCOPE = ""

// EX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE is intentionally not set for region EX
const EX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE = ""

// RX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE is unavailable; update when region RX supports analytics
const RX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE = ""
```

Alternatively, if these constants represent future feature placeholders, consider providing proper defaults or replacing the empty strings with `nil` where appropriate.
