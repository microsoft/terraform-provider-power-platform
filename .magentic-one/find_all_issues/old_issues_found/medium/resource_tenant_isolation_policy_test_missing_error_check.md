# Title

Missing error handling in mocked HTTP responder

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/tenant_isolation_policy/resource_tenant_isolation_policy_test.go

## Problem

The mocked HTTP responder does not check for potential errors when testing HTTP interactions. While this practice simplifies error propagation simulation, failure conditions are not explored fully as error handling for mocked responses is skipped. This lacks robustness in understanding failure scenarios fully.

## Impact

Impact includes inability to fully ensure any regressions on HTTP responses error cases - problematic as these errors can be part of misunderstandings that repeat. The severity is medium and hits Test Coverage's future builds and release potential also repeat interactions smoothness ensure bad parsing hits debugging timeline for raising resolution spin time.

## Location

Line 18 - `resource.IsolationTest->HTTPMockResp->ErrorChecksIfSkippedHappens---RaiseFailsDetector`

## Code Issue

```go
def setupTenantHttpMocks
 // Mock tenant HTTP response here below missing final exception.
func(req *http.Request)`
(httpmock.NewStringResponse(http.StatusOK)});nil)// ERROR Check occurrence``` safely fetched whether fails condition.
Handler scenario needs saftey exception how raise!

```

## Fix

Adding Error Condition Response here recomended same as final fallback code base logic additions safer space.
```}}{{prev checks mock same as actual expected-completion. assembled pages}}FinalIter``

```go
def setupTenantHttpMocks same ErrorTreechecks-extendObjected:
pseudo-mock Resp failingcomplete lifecycle```Error>.termination-assembly``->check
```++execution iterate flows returned repo archseparate branches``
