# Title

Unclear error logging when type assertion fails in `applyCorrections`

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/tenant_settings/api_tenant_settings.go`

## Problem

In the function `applyCorrections`, when the type assertion `correctedFilter.(*tenantSettingsDto)` fails, there is an error log written using `tflog.Error`. However, the error message provided does not include any details about the actual types involved in the assertion, making it harder to debug the issue.

## Impact

This issue impacts the codebase in the following ways:
- Debugging and identifying the cause of the type assertion failure becomes difficult due to insufficient error detail.
- Potential misuse or invalid type handling is less likely to be identified and corrected early.

Severity: **Medium**

## Location

`applyCorrections` function within `/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/tenant_settings/api_tenant_settings.go`.

## Code Issue

```go
	corrected, ok := correctedFilter.(*tenantSettingsDto)
	if !ok {
		tflog.Error(ctx, "Type assertion to failed in applyCorrections")
		return nil
	}
```

## Fix

Update the error log message to include the types involved in the type assertion failure. This provides better information for debugging.

```go
	corrected, ok := correctedFilter.(*tenantSettingsDto)
	if !ok {
		tflog.Error(ctx, fmt.Sprintf("Type assertion failed in applyCorrections. Expected type: %T, but got type: %T", tenantSettingsDto{}, correctedFilter))
		return nil
	}
```

Explanation:
- Using `fmt.Sprintf`, we provide detailed context for the error log, including the expected and actual types.
- This improves debugging capabilities, allowing developers to identify and rectify issues faster.
