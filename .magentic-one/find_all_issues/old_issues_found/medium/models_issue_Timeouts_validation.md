# Title

Field `Timeouts` missing validation in `DataSourceModel`

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/locations/models.go

## Problem

The field `Timeouts` in the `DataSourceModel` struct does not have any explicit validation defined, which could result in unpredictable behavior or errors if invalid data is provided.

## Impact

The lack of validation for the `Timeouts` field may lead to runtime errors and unexpected application behavior, as this field's integrity cannot be ensured. This issue's severity is **medium** since it could disrupt application functionality but does not necessarily expose critical security vulnerabilities.

## Location

Line: 
```go
Timeouts timeouts.Value `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
```

## Code Issue

```go
type DataSourceModel struct {
	Timeouts timeouts.Value `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
	Value    []DataModel    `tfsdk:"locations"`
}
```

## Fix

Explicit validation logic for the `Timeouts` field should be added. This can be achieved by ensuring that the value matches expected constraints, such as acceptable timeout durations or formats, during struct initialization or in the validation phase.

Example:

```go
// ValidateTimeouts ensures that the Timeout field contains a suitable value.
func ValidateTimeouts(value timeouts.Value) error {
    if value.IsNull() || value.IsEmpty() {
        return fmt.Errorf("Timeouts must not be null or empty")
    }
    return nil
}

// Use this validation in your code where necessary
if err := ValidateTimeouts(dataSourceModel.Timeouts); err != nil {
    // Handle validation error
}
```
