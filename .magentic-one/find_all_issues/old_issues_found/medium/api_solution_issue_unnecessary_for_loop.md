# Title

Unnecessary For Loop Implementation

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution/api_solution.go

## Problem

In the `GetSolutions` method, there is a redundant for-loop that assigns the `EnvironmentId` to each solution object within the `solutionArray.Value`. However, this operation could have been handled in a single statement or replaced with a better approach involving slice manipulation.

## Impact

This adds unnecessary performance overhead for large sets of solution objects. Additionally, it reduces readability and maintainability of the method.

Severity: medium

## Location

- Line 75: `GetSolutions` method.

## Code Issue

```go
for inx := range solutionArray.Value {
    solutionArray.Value[inx].EnvironmentId = environmentId
}
```

## Fix

Replace the for-loop with a one-liner using functional programming constructs if appropriate. Alternatively, improve the clarity of the loop. Example fix:

```go
for _, solution := range solutionArray.Value {
    solution.EnvironmentId = environmentId
}
```
