# Title

Improper Handling When Environment Does Not Contain Dataverse

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution/resource_solution.go

## Problem

In the `importSolution` method, when `DataverseExists` returns false, it adds an error to the diagnostics but doesn't halt processing immediately, risking potential flow-through issues.

## Impact

This can lead to subsequent code being executed unnecessarily, and might result in unintended behavior or resource corruption if any operations depend on the presence of Dataverse.

**Severity:** Medium

## Location

Line 357:

```go
if !dvExits {
	diagnostics.AddError(fmt.Sprintf("No Dataverse exists in environment '%s'", plan.EnvironmentId.ValueString()), "")
	return nil
}
```

## Fix

Add a safeguard to terminate the execution flow immediately after detecting that Dataverse does not exist.

```go
if !dvExits {
	diagnostics.AddError(fmt.Sprintf("No Dataverse exists in environment '%s'", plan.EnvironmentId.ValueString()), "")
	return nil
}
```

This ensures that all subsequent logic halts gracefully in cases where a critical precondition is unmet.
