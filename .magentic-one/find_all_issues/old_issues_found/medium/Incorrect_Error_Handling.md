# Title: Incorrect Error Handling in `GetSolutionCheckerRules`

##
`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution_checker_rules/client.go`

## Problem

The function `GetSolutionCheckerRules` does not propagate detailed errors back to the caller in some cases. For instance, when building the query parameters for the `rulesUrl`, the error messages are too generic.

## Impact

This can obscure the root cause of issues during debugging and may lead developers to incorrect assumptions about the failure. Severity: **medium**.

## Location

Line(s):
- Where `url.Parse` is used to parse the advisor URL.
- Lines where query parameters are added and errors generated.

## Code Issue

```go
advisorURL, err := url.Parse(env.Properties.RuntimeEndpoints.PowerAppsAdvisor)
if err != nil {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to parse PowerAppsAdvisor URL: %w", err)
}
```

## Fix

Enhance error handling to include more context, such as indicating which environment caused the error, so debugging is easier.

```go
advisorURL, err := url.Parse(env.Properties.RuntimeEndpoints.PowerAppsAdvisor)
if err != nil {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to parse PowerAppsAdvisor URL (%s) for environment (%s): %w", env.Properties.RuntimeEndpoints.PowerAppsAdvisor, environmentId, err)
}
```
