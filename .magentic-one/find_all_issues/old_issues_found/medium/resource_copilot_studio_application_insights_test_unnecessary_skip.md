# Title

Unnecessary Use of `t.Skip` in Acceptance Test

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/copilot_studio_application_insights/resource_copilot_studio_application_insights_test.go`

## Problem

The `TestAccCopilotStudioApplicationInsights_Validate_Create` test uses `t.Skip("Skipping test due lack of SP support")`. Skipping tests in this way may hinder the reliability of test results in the CI/CD pipeline. If the test is not yet supported or requires service principal (SP) configuration, it should be flagged or refactored to proactively notify developers of pending dependency fulfillment.

## Impact

- **Severity:** Medium
- Tests will not be executed, which could lead to undocumented regressions and unseen issues in functionality.
- Reduces the reliability and comprehensiveness of the testing suite.

## Location

Line 15 in `TestAccCopilotStudioApplicationInsights_Validate_Create` function.

## Code Issue

```go
	t.Skip("Skipping test due lack of SP support")
```

## Fix

Refactor to check for SP support dynamically and conditionally skip the test. Alternatively, notify users of the required configuration to execute the tests successfully.

```go

	// Refactor t.Skip to dynamically check for SP support
	if !mocks.IsSPConfigured() {
		t.Skipf("Skipping %s due to lack of Service Principal support", t.Name())
	}

	// Alternatively, add documentation or notification for developers
	t.Log("Test requires a properly configured Service Principal.")
```
