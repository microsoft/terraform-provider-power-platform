# Title

Unnecessary Redundant State Assignments in `Create` Method

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/resource_environment_application_package_install.go

## Problem

In the `Create` method, the same `state.EnvironmentId` and `state.UniqueName` are being reassigned to their current values redundantly. This is unnecessary and can lead to confusion in the codebase.

## Impact

- Reduces code readability and increases the potential for introducing bugs during future maintenance.
- Such redundancy increases the lines of code and unnecessarily clutters the implementation.
- Severity: Medium since itâ€™s a code quality improvement and does not break functionality.

## Location

```go
state.EnvironmentId = types.StringValue(state.EnvironmentId.ValueString())
state.UniqueName = types.StringValue(state.UniqueName.ValueString())
```

File location: Method `Create`, observed near state assignments.

## Code Issue

```go
state.EnvironmentId = types.StringValue(state.EnvironmentId.ValueString())
state.UniqueName = types.StringValue(state.UniqueName.ValueString())
```

## Fix

Remove redundant assignments to streamline the code and improve readability.

```go
// Redundant assignments can be removed as the values remain unchanged. Simply use `state.EnvironmentId` and `state.UniqueName` directly without reassigning.
```
