***Error in Client Type Check During Configuration***

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_wave/resource_environment_wave.go`

## Problem

In the `Configure` method, the code checks the type of the `req.ProviderData` using Go's type assertion:

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Unexpected Resource Configure Type",
        fmt.Sprintf("Expected *http.Client, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
    )
    return
}
```

However, the error message is misleading as it states the type was expected to be `*http.Client` instead of the correct `*api.ProviderClient`. This can confuse both developers and end users when debugging, especially if the provider is failing due to misconfiguration.

## Impact

- **Severity:** Medium.
- This error message can cause confusion. While it doesn't directly impact the program's execution, it impairs maintainability and troubleshooting efficiency.

## Location

**Function Name:**  
`func (r *Resource) Configure(ctx context.Context, req resource.ConfigureRequest, resp *resource.ConfigureResponse)`

## Code Issue

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Unexpected Resource Configure Type",
        fmt.Sprintf("Expected *http.Client, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
    )
    return
}
```

## Fix

Correct the error message to reflect that the expected type is `*api.ProviderClient`, not `*http.Client`. Additionally, improving clarity by substituting exact expected types can make maintenance easier.

### Fixed Code Example:

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Unexpected Resource Configure Type",
        fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
    )
    return
}
```

### Why Fix This Way?
- Improves the accuracy of error diagnostics provided to the user.
- Prevents confusion for developers when debugging the code or configuring the resource.
- Enhances maintainability as error messages are more intuitively matched with the codebase logic.
