# Issue 4: Use of Deprecated Features in HTTP Mock Library

## Path

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/datasource_environments_test.go`

## Problem

The test file relies on the `httpmock.RegisterResponder` function from `github.com/jarcoal/httpmock`, which may use outdated patterns for handling HTTP responses. Modern libraries like `httptest` in `net/http` or specialized mocking libraries for Go are often preferred for better compatibility and feature sets.

Additionally, direct reliance on string-based paths and file mocks (`httpmock.File`) limits extensibility and flexibility.

## Impact

Using potentially deprecated or less-flexible features may result in compatibility issues with newer frameworks or APIs. It reduces extensibility when adapting these tests to other tools or production environments. Severity: **Medium**.

## Location

Found extensively in the `TestUnitEnvironmentsDataSource_Validate_Read` function.

### Code Issue Example

```go
httpmock.RegisterResponder("GET", `https://api.bap.microsoft.com/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/scopes/admin/environments/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001?%24expand=permissions%2Cproperties.capacity%2Cproperties%2FbillingPolicy&api-version=2023-06-01`,
    func(req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
        return httpmock.NewStringResponse(http.StatusOK, httpmock.File("tests/datasource/Validate_Read/get_environment_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001.json").String()), nil
    })
```

### Fix

Refactor the logic using more modern libraries such as `httptest`:

```go
ts := httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    if r.URL.Path == "/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/scopes/admin/environments" {
        http.ServeFile(w, r, "./tests/datasource/Validate_Read/get_environment_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001.json")
        return
    }
    http.Error(w, "Not Found", http.StatusNotFound)
}))
defer ts.Close()

// Use ts.URL dynamically in your code instead of hardcoded API endpoints.
```

Switching to `httptest` improves flexibility, readability, and compatibility with modern Go testing environments.
