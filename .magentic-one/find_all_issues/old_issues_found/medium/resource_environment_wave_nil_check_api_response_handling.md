# Title

***Incorrect Handling of Nil Checks for API Responses***

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_wave/resource_environment_wave.go`

## Problem

In the `Read` method, there is a nil check for the `feature` object:

```go
if feature == nil {
    resp.State.RemoveResource(ctx)
    return
}
```

While this handles the case where the API may not return a feature, it does so without logging or providing diagnostics. This can make it very difficult to debug why the state was removed when the API does not return an expected response. Additionally, it does not differentiate between different causes (e.g., network issues, API bugs, or feature simply not existing).

## Impact

- **Severity:** Medium.
- Lack of proper logs or diagnostics makes debugging harder when the API does not return a feature.
- Users and maintainers cannot easily understand why the resource has been removed from the state.
- Can cause silent errors to propagate unnoticed, impacting overall system reliability.

## Location

**Function Name:**  
`func (r *Resource) Read(ctx context.Context, req resource.ReadRequest, resp *resource.ReadResponse)`

## Code Issue

```go
if feature == nil {
    resp.State.RemoveResource(ctx)
    return
}
```

## Fix

Enhance the nil check to include logging and add diagnostic information. This makes the reason for the removal clearer, especially in production scenarios.

### Fixed Code Example:

```go
if feature == nil {
    tflog.Warn(ctx, fmt.Sprintf("Feature for environment ID '%s' and feature name '%s' was not found. Removing resource from state.",
        state.EnvironmentId.ValueString(), state.FeatureName.ValueString()))

    resp.Diagnostics.AddWarning(
        "Feature Not Found",
        fmt.Sprintf("The feature '%s' in environment '%s' could not be found. The resource will be removed from the Terraform state.",
            state.FeatureName.ValueString(), state.EnvironmentId.ValueString()),
    )
    resp.State.RemoveResource(ctx)
    return
}
```

### Why Fix This Way?
- The added warning log provides clarity about what happened, making debugging easier.
- The diagnostic message informs the user about why the resource is being removed, reducing confusion.
- This ensures maintainability and better user experience in case of API inconsistencies or other issues.
