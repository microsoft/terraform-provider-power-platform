# Title

No validation of response status code

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/languages/api_languages.go`

## Problem

Although the `Execute` function filters on specific status codes (`http.StatusOK`), there is no secondary validation within the context of `GetLanguagesByLocation`. The function assumes success without verifying the status code, which may lead to unexpected outcomes if the `Execute` method does not strictly enforce status code validation.

## Impact

Potentially undefined behavior if invalid status codes slip through the `Execute` method. Severity is **medium**.

## Location

Handling response in `GetLanguagesByLocation`

## Code Issue

```go
response, err := client.Api.Execute(ctx, nil, "GET", apiUrl.String(), nil, nil, []int{http.StatusOK}, nil)
```

## Fix

Include additional verification of the HTTP response's status code before proceeding further.

```go
if response.HttpResponse.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
    return languages, fmt.Errorf("unexpected response status: %d", response.HttpResponse.StatusCode)
}
```
