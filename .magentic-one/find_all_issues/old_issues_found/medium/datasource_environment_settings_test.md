# Issue 2

## Title

Unnecessary Activation of HTTP Mock Without Validation of Behavior

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_settings/datasource_environment_settings_test.go`

## Problem

In the function `TestUnitTestEnvironmentSettingsDataSource_Validate_Read` and `TestUnitTestEnvironmentSettingsDataSource_Validate_No_Dataverse`, HTTP mock activation (`httpmock.Activate()` and `httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()`) is carried out, but there is no specific mechanism to test that the mocks are used properly to intercept the intended HTTP calls. Without validation, there is the possibility that some API calls will bypass the mock system.

## Impact

Unvalidated HTTP mock usage may lead to unintended communication with actual external APIs during test execution or silent failures where mocks are not being correctly used in tests. Severity: **Medium**

## Location

```go
httpmock.Activate()
defer httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
```

## Code Issue

```go
httpmock.Activate()
defer httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
```

## Fix

Add validation logic after activation of HTTP mock to ensure required HTTP calls are intercepted properly by the mock system.

```go
httpmock.Activate()
defer func() {
	if len(httpmock.GetCallCountInfo()) == 0 {
		t.Error("HTTP calls were not intercepted as expected")
	}
	httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
}()
```
