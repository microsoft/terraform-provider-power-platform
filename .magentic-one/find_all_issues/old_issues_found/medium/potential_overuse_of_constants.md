# Title

Potential Overuse of Constants Without Grouped Logical Structures

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_group_rule_set/constants.go`

## Problem

While constants improve the maintainability of code, this file may be overusing string constants for features without logical struct grouping. For example, constants like `SOLUTION_CHECKER_MODE` and `SUPPRESS_VALIDATION_EMAILS` are placed independently and rely on developers remembering their connections to the solution checker feature.

## Impact

- **Severity**: Medium
Poor organization results in reduced readability, especially as the file grows or the number of constants increases. Developers may introduce bugs by inaccurately referencing or grouping features that don't have encapsulated structures.

## Location

Lines related to solution checker:  
Lines 22â€“27:
```go
const (
	SOLUTION_CHECKER_ENFORCEMENT    = "SolutionChecker"
	SOLUTION_CHECKER_MODE           = "solutionCheckerMode"
	SUPPRESS_VALIDATION_EMAILS      = "suppressValidationEmails"
	SOLUTION_CHECKER_RULE_OVERRIDES = "solutionCheckerRuleOverrides"
)
```

## Code Issue

The constants are defined without sufficient structuring to indicate their dependency or logical grouping:

```go
const (
	SOLUTION_CHECKER_ENFORCEMENT    = "SolutionChecker"
	SOLUTION_CHECKER_MODE           = "solutionCheckerMode"
	SUPPRESS_VALIDATION_EMAILS      = "suppressValidationEmails"
	SOLUTION_CHECKER_RULE_OVERRIDES = "solutionCheckerRuleOverrides"
)
```

## Fix

Group these constants using a struct to enhance readability and maintainability:

```go
type SolutionCheckerConfig struct {
	Enforcement    string
	Mode           string
	SuppressEmails string
	RuleOverrides  string
}

// Initialize Solution Checker Config constants
var SolutionChecker = SolutionCheckerConfig{
	Enforcement:    "SolutionChecker",
	Mode:           "solutionCheckerMode",
	SuppressEmails: "suppressValidationEmails",
	RuleOverrides:  "solutionCheckerRuleOverrides",
}
```

This way, developers can reference `SolutionChecker.Enforcement`, making it clear they are working with a logically defined feature.
