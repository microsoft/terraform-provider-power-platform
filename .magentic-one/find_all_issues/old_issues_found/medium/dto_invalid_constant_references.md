# Title

Invalid constant value references lead to potential misconfigurations

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_group_rule_set/dto.go

## Problem

This file contains multiple constant references such as `AI_GENERATIVE_SETTINGS`, `NOT_SPECIFIED`, `SHARING`, etc. However, the definitions and values of these constants are not provided in the file. If these constants are improperly defined elsewhere, it could lead to misconfigurations or inconsistencies in the application behavior.

## Impact

- Hard to trace constant values leading to poor debugging experience.
- Lack of inline or external value documentation may confuse developers regarding defined behavior.

Severity: Medium

## Location

Examples of constant references can be found extensively, e.g.:

```go
Type: AI_GENERATIVE_SETTINGS, ResourceType: NOT_SPECIFIED
Type: SHARING, ResourceType: APP
Id: CAN_SHARE_WITH_SECURITY_GROUPS, Value: NO_LIMIT
```

## Code Issue

Example code snippets showcasing constant dependencies:

```go
rule := environmentGroupRuleSetParameterDto{
	HasStagedChanges: &hasStatedChanges,
	Type:             AI_GENERATIVE_SETTINGS,
	ResourceType:     NOT_SPECIFIED,
	Value:            make([]environmentGroupRuleSetValueDto, 0),
}

// Expect constant definitions aligning seamlessly
assert.Equal(nil, AI_GENERATIVE_SETTINGS, dto.Type, fmt.Sprintf("Type should be %s", AI_GENERATIVE_SETTINGS))
```

## Fix

Ensure proper documentation and validation of constant definitions to track the actual values they represent. Confirm their alignment with the intended configuration across the application.

Document the constants at an appropriate location, for example:

```go
const (
	AI_GENERATIVE_SETTINGS = "AI_Generative_Settings"
	NOT_SPECIFIED = "Not_Specified"
	SHARING = "Sharing"
)
```

This provides clarity and avoids ambiguity in their usage.
