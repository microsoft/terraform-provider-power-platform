# Issue 5

## Title

Failure to Handle File Read Errors Gracefully in `GetCertificateRawFromCertOrFilePath`

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/helpers/cert.go`

## Problem

If an error occurs while reading the certificate file using `os.ReadFile`, the error is returned directly without indicating file-specific details to the user or administrator. This limits the usefulness of the information provided when attempting to debug.

## Impact

- The function cannot differentiate between file access issues (e.g., permissions) and invalid file content, making error resolution slower.
- Severity: **Medium**

## Location

- `func GetCertificateRawFromCertOrFilePath`

## Code Issue

```go
pfx, err := os.ReadFile(certificateFilePath)
if err != nil {
    return "", err
}
```

## Fix

Enhance the error handling code to provide specific file operation details. Include the file path and the context of the error.

```go
pfx, err := os.ReadFile(certificateFilePath)
if err != nil {
    return "", fmt.Errorf("unable to read certificate file at '%s': %w", certificateFilePath, err)
}
```

Improved error messages like this ensure that users have more context when file-related issues occur, making it easier to resolve problems.
