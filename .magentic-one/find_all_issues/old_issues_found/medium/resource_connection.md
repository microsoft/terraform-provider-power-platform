# Title

Use of hardcoded string values for connection environment path

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connection/resource_connection.go

## Problem

The code snippet contains hardcoded strings used in defining the connection environment path `/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/environments/%s`. Hardcoding such values in the logic ties the implementation to a specific structure, making the code less maintainable and difficult to update if the schema changes.

## Impact

- **Severity:** Medium  
- Any changes to the hardcoded path, such as a shift in API or data structure format, would require the code to be changed manually in multiple places.
- Makes the code brittle and less flexible.
- Hardcoding reduces the adaptability during testing or integrating with different environments.

## Location

```go
Id:   fmt.Sprintf("/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/environments/%s", plan.EnvironmentId.ValueString()),
```

## Code Issue

```go
Id:   fmt.Sprintf("/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/environments/%s", plan.EnvironmentId.ValueString()),
```

## Fix

```go
// Centralize definition of connection environment path in a constant or configuration variable.
const connectionEnvironmentPathTemplate = "/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/environments/%s"

connectionToCreate := createDto{
    Properties: createPropertiesDto{
        DisplayName: plan.DisplayName.ValueString(),
        Environment: createEnvironmentDto{
            Name: plan.EnvironmentId.ValueString(),
            Id:   fmt.Sprintf(connectionEnvironmentPathTemplate, plan.EnvironmentId.ValueString()),
        },
    },
}
```

Explanation: Using a constant or configurable string for paths allows easier maintenance. This ensures consistency across the codebase and simplifies updates in case external APIs or requirements change.
