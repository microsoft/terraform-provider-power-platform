# Title

Lack of Context Error Validation in Metadata Method

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/capacity/datasource_tenant_capacity.go`

## Problem

The `Metadata` method utilizes `helpers.EnterRequestContext` and assigns the resulting `exitContext` for later usage but assumes no error will occur during context configuration or retrieval. No validation checks are performed for error states in context initialization.

## Impact

This omission leaves the code vulnerable to obscure errors during execution, particularly when helper functions or external dependencies fail. Errors could propagate silently, leading to incorrect state or logs. **Severity is medium**, as context issues impact the reliability of logging and metadata provisioning.

## Location

Line in the `Metadata` method where `helpers.EnterRequestContext` is invoked.

## Code Issue

```go
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, d.TypeInfo, req)
defer exitContext()
```

## Fix

Introduce error validation immediately after context initialization to catch potential issues.

```go
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, d.TypeInfo, req)
if ctx == nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Context Initialization Error",
        "The request context could not be initialized successfully.",
    )
    return
}
defer exitContext()
```

This ensures robustness in context management and enhances diagnostic logging for debugging purposes.
