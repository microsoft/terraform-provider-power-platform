# Title
Unclear error messages in `convertToDlpConnectorGroup`.

##
/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/dlp_policy/helpers.go

## Problem
Error messages such as `"Client error when converting DlpConnectorGroups"` provide insufficient context for debugging. There is no indication of the exact issue encountered during the conversion process.

---

## Impact
Unclear error messages reduce the ability to identify the root cause of issues, elongating debugging time and downtime. This is considered **medium severity** as it does not directly break functionality but hampers usability and debugging.

## Code Issue

```go
	err := connectorsAttr.ElementsAs(ctx, &connectors, true)
	if err != nil {
		diags.AddError("Client error when converting DlpConnectorGroups", "")
	}
```
---

## Fix

```go
// Improve error messaging by including specific error details and context.
	err := connectorsAttr.ElementsAs(ctx, &connectors, true)
	if err != nil {
		diags.AddError("Error converting elements in DlpConnectorGroups", fmt.Sprintf("Details: %v", err))
	}
```

Explanation: The fix enhances the error reporting mechanism by appending `err` details to the message, which provides more clarity about the failure.
