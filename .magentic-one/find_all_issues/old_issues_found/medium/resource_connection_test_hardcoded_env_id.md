# Title

Hardcoded Environment ID in Unit Test `TestUnitConnectionsResource_Validate_Create`

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connection/resource_connection_test.go

## Problem

The `environment_id` value in the unit test is hardcoded as `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`. Hardcoding such values reduces flexibility and might fail in integration setups requiring dynamically created environments.

#### Violating Code:

```go
environment_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

## Impact

- **Severity**: Medium
- Test dependency on hardcoded values reduces portability across different testing or staging setups. Tests might fail if a specific environment setup is required but cannot utilize the hardcoded value.

## Location

In `TestUnitConnectionsResource_Validate_Create`:
- Line 80

## Fix

Replace with dynamic values or mock framework variables representing valid environment IDs. Example:

```go
environment_id = mocks.TestEnvironmentID()
```
