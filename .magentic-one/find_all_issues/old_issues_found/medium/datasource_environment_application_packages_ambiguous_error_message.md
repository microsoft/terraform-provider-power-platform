# Title: Ambiguous Error Message in `Configure` Method for Unexpected Provider Data Type

## Path to file
`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/datasource_environment_application_packages.go`

## Problem
The error message written when `req.ProviderData` is of an unexpected type is overly generic. No actionable details are provided a user would need to debug the issue effectively.

## Impact
- **Debugging Challenge:** Developers and users may find it difficult to diagnose what went wrong.
- **User Frustration:** The error message does not adequately guide the user toward resolving the problem.

Severity: **Medium**

## Location
Function `Configure`, Code snippet:
```go
resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
    "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
    fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
)
```

## Code Issue
```go
resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
    "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
    fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
)
```

## Fix
Update the error message to include actionable details for the user to resolve issues with configuration.

```go
resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
    "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
    fmt.Sprintf(
        "Expected ProviderData of type *api.ProviderClient, but received type '%T'. "+
        "This may occur due to a misconfiguration in the provider or a coding error. "+
        "Please check your provider configuration and ensure it is correctly set in Terraform. "+
        "If the problem persists, report this issue to the provider developers.",
        req.ProviderData,
    ),
)
```

Explanation:
- Provides diagnostic details, including the expected and received type.
- Offers guidance to review provider configuration settings.
- Suggests escalation to the developers only if the user cannot resolve the issue independently.
