# Title

Constant Group Redundancy in Different Scopes

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_group_rule_set/constants.go`

## Problem

The file defines multiple constant groups for related purposes, but they are scattered across different `const` blocks, leading to redundancy and potential areas of confusion. For example, constants related to AI features or Solution Checker could be grouped logically and consolidated to enhance clarity.

## Impact

- **Severity**: Medium  
  Scattered constants reduce code organization and maintainability. It becomes harder for developers to locate related constants, increasing the risk of duplicate definitions or inconsistent updates.

## Location

For example:  
Lines 35–39: Related to `AI_GENERATED_DESC`  
Lines 41–45: Related to `GenerativeAISettings`

## Code Issue

Here’s an example of fragmented constant groups:

```go
const (
	AI_GENERATED_DESC                 = "Copilot"
	DISABLE_AI_GENERATED_DESCRIPTIONS = "DisableAiGeneratedDescriptions"
)

const (
	AI_GENERATIVE_SETTINGS                  = "GenerativeAISettings"
	CROSS_GEO_COPILOT_DATA_MOVEMENT_ENABLED = "crossGeoCopilotDataMovementEnabled"
	BING_CHAT_ENABLED                       = "bingChatEnabled"
)
```

## Fix

Combine these related constants into a single logical group to enhance clarity and organization:

```go
const (
	AI_GENERATED_DESC                         = "Copilot"
	DISABLE_AI_GENERATED_DESCRIPTIONS         = "DisableAiGeneratedDescriptions"
	AI_GENERATIVE_SETTINGS                    = "GenerativeAISettings"
	CROSS_GEO_COPILOT_DATA_MOVEMENT_ENABLED   = "crossGeoCopilotDataMovementEnabled"
	BING_CHAT_ENABLED                         = "bingChatEnabled"
)
```
