# Title

Unnecessary usage of `context.WithCancel`

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connection/resource_connection_share.go

## Problem

The `helpers.EnterRequestContext` function appears to call `context.WithCancel`, and the returned `exitContext`, which should be used for cancelation, is defer-called immediately after its declaration:

```go
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, r.TypeInfo, req)
defer exitContext()
```

While the principle of cleaning resources with a cancelation context is sound, it is misused since `exitContext` is effectively redundant. It does not actually contribute to managing _long-running processes_ but instead creates unnecessary cancelation mechanisms prematurely.

## Impact

- Introduces unnecessary complexity and potential future bugs if canceled prematurely or incorrectly.
- Causes redundancy that hinders readability without contributing to actual functionality.
- **Severity**: _Medium impact_, as the code executes correctly but adds confusion and potential risk.

## Location

```go
// Example of redundant context usage
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, r.TypeInfo, req)
defer exitContext()
```

## Code Issue

Repeated pattern in `Metadata`, `Schema`, `Configure`, and other functions:

```go
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, r.TypeInfo, req)
defer exitContext()
```

## Fix

Refactor `helpers.EnterRequestContext` to exclude `exitContext`, unless `exitContext` serves valuable semantics. Alternatively, remove the call to `defer exitContext()` and use standard `ctx` handling as follows:

```go
// Updated pattern for context handling
ctx = helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, r.TypeInfo, req)
// Proceed with regular operation logic, no need for redundant cancelation
```

OR utilize `exitContext` only if sub-processes need explicit cancellation.

Save this change for better context lifecycle management.
