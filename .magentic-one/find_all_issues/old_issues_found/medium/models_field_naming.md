# Title

Ambiguous Field Naming in `SourceModel`

## Path

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/models.go`

## Problem

Fields such as `Cadence`, `AzureRegion`, and `OwnerId` are used in `SourceModel`. These names do not provide enough context as to their purpose, potentially leading to confusion about their intent or use.

## Impact

- Reduces code readability, especially for new developers joining the project.
- Could lead to misuse or misunderstanding of these fields.
- Severity: Medium.

## Location

Defined in the `SourceModel` type.

## Code Issue

```go
type SourceModel struct {
	Cadence                      types.String       `tfsdk:"cadence"`
	AzureRegion                  types.String       `tfsdk:"azure_region"`
	OwnerId                      types.String       `tfsdk:"owner_id"`
	// other fields...
}
```

## Fix

Add explicit documentation comments to these fields or rename them to more descriptive alternatives.

```go
type SourceModel struct {
	// Cadence refers to the update frequency or rhythm for environments.
	UpdateScheduleFrequency types.String `tfsdk:"cadence"`

	// AzureRegion refers to the physical location within Azure infrastructure.
	RegionIdentifier types.String `tfsdk:"azure_region"`

	// OwnerId refers to the unique identifier for the owner entity.
	EnvironmentOwnerIdentifier types.String `tfsdk:"owner_id"`
}
```
