# Title

Inconsistent Context Propagation in `GetLocations`

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/locations/api_locations.go`

## Problem

The `context.Context` object passed to the `GetLocations` function is used in the request to `client.Api.Execute`, but its propagation is not explicitly ensured in chained calls. While there are no immediate signs of context misuse, it's recommended to verify that all downstream calls respect the termination signals and request-scoped deadlines represented by this `context`.

## Impact

Failure to properly respect or propagate the provided `context.Context` object can lead to resource leaks or unresponsive operations if a request's cancellation or timeout isn't appropriately handled. This could result in degraded application performance and maintainability issues.

**Severity: Medium**

## Location

- File: `api_locations.go`
- Function: `GetLocations`
- Context propagation section

## Code Issue

```go
_, err := client.Api.Execute(ctx, nil, "GET", apiUrl.String(), nil, nil, []int{http.StatusOK}, &locations)
return locations, err
```

## Fix

Ensure proper context propagation and verify that all downstream operations respect cancellation and deadlines from the `context`. Modern Go tools allow for code analysis to detect direct misuse. Explicit propagation, when possible, is always preferred.

```go
func (client *client) GetLocations(ctx context.Context) (locationDto, error) {
	// Check if context has been canceled before executing the API request
	if err := ctx.Err(); err != nil {
		return locationDto{}, fmt.Errorf("context error prior to executing request: %w", err)
	}

	apiUrl := &url.URL{
		Scheme: constants.HTTPS,
		Host:   client.Api.GetConfig().Urls.BapiUrl,
		Path:   "/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/locations",
		RawQuery: url.Values{
			"api-version": []string{"2023-06-01"},
		}.Encode(),
	}

	var locations locationDto
	resp, err := client.Api.Execute(ctx, nil, "GET", apiUrl.String(), nil, nil, []int{http.StatusOK}, &locations)
	if ctx.Err() != nil {
		return locationDto{}, fmt.Errorf("operation canceled or expired after API execution: %w", ctx.Err())
	}
	return locations, err
}
```
