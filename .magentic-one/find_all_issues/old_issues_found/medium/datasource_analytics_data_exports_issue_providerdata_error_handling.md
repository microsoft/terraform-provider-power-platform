# Title

Unexpected ProviderData Type Error Handling Improvement

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/analytics_data_export/datasource_analytics_data_exports.go`

## Problem

The `Configure` method throws a highly generic error when the `ProviderData` type is not as expected, paired with a message advising the user to report the issue. However, this doesn't give enough diagnostic information to debug or understand the circumstances under which the error occurs. The error handling could include better logging or suggest specific actions the developers or users should take.

## Impact

- **Severity:** Medium  
- Users encountering this error will face difficulty in obtaining actionable diagnostic or remediation steps.
- Developers debugging with insufficient insight will expend more time on troubleshooting, impacting productivity.

## Location

`AnalyticsExportDataSource.Configure`

## Code Issue

```go
	if req.ProviderData == nil {
		// ProviderData will be null when Configure is called from ValidateConfig. It's ok.
		return
	}

	client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
	if !ok {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
			"Unexpected ProviderData Type",
			fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
		)
		return
	}

	d.analyticsExportClient = NewAnalyticsExportClient(client.Api, tenant.NewTenantClient(client.Api))
```

## Fix

Enhance the error reporting to include additional diagnostic information such as Client values (if null and representations):
```go
	client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
	if !ok {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
			"Unexpected ProviderData Type",
			fmt.Sprintf(
				"Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. This typically indicates a misconfiguration in the provider setup. Verify the provider configuration or contact the developers with detailed steps leading to this error. ProviderData value: %v",
				req.ProviderData,
				req.ProviderData,
			),
		)
		return
	}
```
