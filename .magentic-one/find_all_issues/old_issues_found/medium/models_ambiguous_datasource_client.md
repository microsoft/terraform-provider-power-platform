# Title

Ambiguous DataSource field `LanguagesClient`

## Path

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/languages/models.go

## Problem

The `DataSource` struct has a field `LanguagesClient` but lacks clear type definition (`client`) or implementation details. It is not evident what `client` refers to or how it interacts with the other fields in the struct.

## Impact

This ambiguity impacts code readability and may lead to implementation errors, as future developers or maintainers of the code may not understand the purpose of the `LanguagesClient`. Moreover, the struct is less reusable because its dependency is unclear. **Severity: Medium**

## Location

`LanguagesClient` in the `DataSource` struct

```go
type DataSource struct {
  helpers.TypeInfo
  LanguagesClient client
}
```

## Code Issue

Undefined and generic `client` type used for `LanguagesClient`.

```go
type DataSource struct {
  helpers.TypeInfo
  LanguagesClient client
}
```

## Fix

Define or clarify what `client` refers to within the context of the project, and then replace the placeholder type. For example, if `LanguagesClient` is intended to connect to an API:

```go
type APIClient struct {
  BaseURL string
  AuthKey string
}

type DataSource struct {
  helpers.TypeInfo
  LanguagesClient *APIClient
}
```

This change makes the `LanguagesClient` type more explicit and ensures that users understand its dependencies or properties.
