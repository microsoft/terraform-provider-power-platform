# Title

Improper error handling for `providerserver.Serve`.

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/main.go`

## Problem

The error handling for `providerserver.Serve` uses `log.Fatalf`, which abruptly terminates the program if an error occurs. While this approach is valid for small applications, it is not ideal for larger systems or for cases where graceful error recovery is needed. Using `log.Fatalf` also makes unit testing harder due to the direct program termination.

## Impact

- Lack of graceful recovery mechanism impacts the stability and maintainability of the application.
- If the application were to expand in scope, rigid error handling may become problematic.
- Severity: Medium.

## Location

Lines 28-32:
`main.go`

## Code Issue

```go
err := providerserver.Serve(ctx, provider.NewPowerPlatformProvider(ctx), serveOpts)

if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Error serving provider: %s", err)
}
```

## Fix

Replace `log.Fatalf` with a strategy that either gracefully recovers from the error or handles it in a way that doesnâ€™t involve abrupt termination. For instance:

```go
err := providerserver.Serve(ctx, provider.NewPowerPlatformProvider(ctx), serveOpts)

if err != nil {
	log.Printf("[ERROR] Failed to serve the provider: %s", err)
	// Additional cleanup or recovery actions can be performed here.
	os.Exit(1) // Use os.Exit to gracefully close the application if necessary.
}
```
