# Title

Inefficient Use of the `ctx` Parameter in Multiple Functions

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution_checker_rules/datasource_solution_checker_rules.go

## Problem

The `ctx` parameter is passed to multiple helper functions such as `EnterRequestContext` in the `Metadata`, `Schema`, `Configure`, and `Read` methods. Each of these calls creates a new context that is not reutilized efficiently. Additionally, there is no clear mechanism to check for cancellations or deadlines during potentially long-running operations like API calls in the `Read` function.

## Impact

- **Severity**: Medium
Efficient context usage is critical in long-running processes to avoid resource leaks or hanging operations when cancellations or deadlines are issued.
- Missing checks for cancellation or deadlines in the `Read` function's API call can lead to degraded performance or unresponsiveness under certain conditions.

## Location

The issue pertains primarily to the usage of `ctx` in the following snippets across the file:

## Code Issue

```go
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, d.TypeInfo, req)
defer exitContext()
```

This pattern appears in the `Metadata`, `Schema`, `Configure`, and `Read` methods. However, the `Read` function is of particular concern.

## Fix

Refactor the context handling to ensure efficient reusability and handling of cancellations or deadlines. In the `Read` function, for example, check for context cancellation or deadlines before invoking the API calls:

```go
select {
case <-ctx.Done():
	resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
		"Context Cancelled",
		fmt.Sprintf("Operation cancelled while reading %s: %s", d.FullTypeName(), ctx.Err()),
	)
	return
default:
	// Proceed with the API call
}
```

Additionally, centralize or streamline the context management logic to avoid repeated patterns and promote code reusability.
