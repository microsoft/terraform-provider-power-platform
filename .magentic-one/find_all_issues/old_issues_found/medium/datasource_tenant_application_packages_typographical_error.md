# Title

Typographical Error in Attribute Field Name: `application_descprition`

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/datasource_tenant_application_packages.go`

## Problem

In the `Schema` method, the attribute field `application_descprition` has a typographical error. The correct spelling should be `application_description`. Similarly, this typo is repeated in the `Read` method where the field is assigned values.

## Impact

This issue can lead to confusion among developers and users of this resource, and potentially result in runtime errors if APIs or other parts of the system expect the correct spelling. Severity: **medium**.

## Location

- `Schema` method in the attribute definitions.
- `Read` method in the construction of the `TenantApplicationPackageDataSourceModel`.

## Code Issue

```go
"application_descprition": schema.StringAttribute{
    MarkdownDescription: "Applicaiton Description",
    Computed:            true,
},

app := TenantApplicationPackageDataSourceModel{
    ApplicationDescprition: types.StringValue(application.ApplicationDescription),
    // ...
}
```

## Fix

Update the attribute's name from `application_descprition` to `application_description` in both the `Schema` and `Read` methods.

```go
"application_description": schema.StringAttribute{
    MarkdownDescription: "Application Description",
    Computed:            true,
},

app := TenantApplicationPackageDataSourceModel{
    ApplicationDescription: types.StringValue(application.ApplicationDescription),
    // ...
}
```
