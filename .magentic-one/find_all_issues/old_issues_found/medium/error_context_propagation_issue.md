# Issue Report: Lack of Error Context Propagation

## File Path:
`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/tenant/api_tenant.go`

## Problem
Errors returned from the `client.Api.Execute` method are simply returned without adding any context. This could lead to challenges in debugging, as developers won't be able to tell where or why the error occurred without inspecting the full stack trace or using external debugging tools. 

For example, the `return nil, err` line (line 32) does not include any meaningful details like API endpoint or method name in the error message.

## Impact
Without proper error propagation:
- Debugging issues becomes harder since the error lacks contextual information.
- If multiple calls are stacked or executed within a batch call, distinguishing errors based on the API endpoint is impossible.
- User-facing or logfile errors might be ambiguous and hard to relate to the actual problem.

## Severity:
***Medium***

## Location
The issue is found at line 32 in the following block:
```go
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}
```

## Code Issue
```go
return nil, err
```

## Recommendation / Fix
Wrap the error using Go's `fmt.Errorf` or `errors` package to add meaningful context.

### Suggested Code Fix
```go
if err != nil {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to execute %s request to %s: %w", "GET", apiUrl.String(), err)
}
```

This approach propagates the error while adding context that includes the HTTP method and endpoint for easier troubleshooting.
