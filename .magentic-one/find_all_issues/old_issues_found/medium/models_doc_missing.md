# Issue: Missing Documentation for Structs

## File
`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/admin_management_application/models.go`

## Severity
Medium

## Problem
The `AdminManagementApplicationResource` and `AdminManagementApplicationResourceModel` structs are not provided with any comments explaining what they represent or their fields' purposes. In professional Go code, it is recommended to document structs and their fields to provide clarity for developers using or maintaining the code.

## Impact
Developers will have to infer the meaning and purpose of these structs and their fields from their names and usage elsewhere in the codebase, which may lead to misunderstanding or misuse.

## Location
```go
type AdminManagementApplicationResource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	AdminManagementApplicationClient client
}

type AdminManagementApplicationResourceModel struct {
	Timeouts timeouts.Value        `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
	Id       customtypes.UUIDValue `tfsdk:"id"`
}
```

## Fix
The structs should be documented with comments describing their purpose and the meaning of their fields. For example:

```go
// AdminManagementApplicationResource represents the admin management application resource.
// It contains type information and a client for interacting with the application.
type AdminManagementApplicationResource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo                        // TypeInfo provides metadata about the resource type.
	AdminManagementApplicationClient client // Client for communicating with admin management application.
}

// AdminManagementApplicationResourceModel is the schema model for the admin management application resource.
// It includes fields for timeouts and an ID.
type AdminManagementApplicationResourceModel struct {
	Timeouts timeouts.Value        `tfsdk:"timeouts"` // Configuration for resource timeouts.
	Id       customtypes.UUIDValue `tfsdk:"id"`       // Unique identifier for the resource.
}
```
