# Title

Using `math/rand/v2` in TestAccBillingPoliciesEnvironmentsDataSource_Validate_Read()

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/datasource_billing_policies_environments_test.go

## Problem

The `math/rand/v2` package is imported and used in the `TestAccBillingPoliciesEnvironmentsDataSource_Validate_Read` function. However, the `math/rand/v2` package is not a recognized or standard library package. Instead, Go's standard library contains the `math/rand` package. This inclusion may be an oversight or the result of incompatible or third-party library usage.

## Impact

The impact includes severe compatibility issues with other libraries or the Go runtime environment, leading to build or runtime errors. This is a critical problem because it could prevent the tests from being executed correctly or crash the application.

## Location

The issue is present in the imports section.

## Code Issue

```go
import (
    "math/rand/v2"
    ...
)
...
name      = "power-platform-billing-` + strconv.Itoa(rand.IntN(9999)) + `"
```

## Fix

Replace the `math/rand/v2` package import with the Go standard library's `math/rand` package:

```go
import (
    "math/rand" // Correct import of standard library
    ...
)
...
// Replace the usage accordingly:
name      = "power-platform-billing-` + strconv.Itoa(rand.Intn(9999)) + `"
```
