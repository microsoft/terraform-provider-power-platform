# Title

Missing LicensingClient Implementation

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/models.go

## Problem

The field `LicensingClient` is declared in multiple structs (e.g., `BillingPoliciesEnvironmetsDataSource` and `BillingPoliciesDataSource`) but lacks any visible implementation or definition. Without an implementation, this client cannot perform its intended operations, such as accessing licensing APIs or resources.

## Impact

- **Severity**: Critical 
- This blocks the use of `LicensingClient`, making the structs incomplete and non-functional for expected licensing data operations. Production systems that rely on this client will experience failure or will not function as designed.
- It risks breaking dependent functionality downstream of these definitions.

## Location

Within structs:
1. `BillingPoliciesEnvironmetsDataSource`
2. `BillingPoliciesDataSource`
3. `BillingPolicyEnvironmentResource`
4. `BillingPolicyResource`

## Code Issue

```go
// Example

// LicensingClient is defined here but lacks an actual implementation.
type BillingPoliciesDataSource struct {
    helpers.TypeInfo
    LicensingClient Client
}
```

## Fix

To resolve this issue, an implementation or import of the correct LicensingClient definition is needed. Identify the intended operations and ensure the client performs them via a concrete struct. Example:

```go
// Implementing LicensingClient

type LicensingClient struct {
    APIClient *SomeAPIClient // A proper API client handling the requests.
}

func (c *LicensingClient) GetLicensingData() (*LicensingData, error) {
    // Implementation code here
    return nil, nil
}
}

// Update the original structs
type BillingPoliciesDataSource struct {
    helpers.TypeInfo
    LicensingClient *LicensingClient // Refers to the implemented client.
}
```
