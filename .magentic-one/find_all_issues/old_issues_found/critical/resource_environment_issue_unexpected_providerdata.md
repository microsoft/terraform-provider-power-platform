# Title

Unexpected ProviderData Type in Configure Method

## Path

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/resource_environment.go

## Problem

In the `Configure` method of the `Resource` struct, the code assumes that `req.ProviderData` should always be of type `*api.ProviderClient`. However, this assumption is not validated sufficiently, and if a different type is provided, the code will silently return after logging a diagnostic error. This can lead to situations where the resource remains unconfigured, causing runtime failures or undefined behavior.

## Impact

- Impacts the stability of the provider by introducing potential runtime errors when `ValidateConfig` or similar logic fails.
- Severity: **Critical** because it affects the foundational setup of the resource.

## Location

File: `/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/resource_environment.go`

Code Issue:

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
        fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
    )
    return
}
```

## Fix

To ensure accurate validation and better error handling, the method should internally ensure that `ProviderData` satisfies one of the expected conditions and offer steps for remedy in both cases:

```go
if req.ProviderData == nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "ProviderData Missing",
        "Configuration cannot proceed as ProviderData is nil. Please ensure the provider is properly configured.",
    )
    return
}

client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
        fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
    )
    return
}
```
