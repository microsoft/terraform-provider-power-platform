`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/dlp_policy/resource_dlp_policy.go`

## Problem

The following code uses non-context-bound functions within asynchronous operations, potentially causing issues with managing resources and request contexts correctly:

```go
resp.State.Set(ctx, &state)
