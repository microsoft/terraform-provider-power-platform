# Title

Improper Error Handling During HTTP Request Execution in `Execute` Method.

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/api/client.go

## Problem

The error handling in the `Execute` method does not provide detailed context or log additional metadata when an error occurs. While basic error wrapping is implemented, the errors can be ambiguous, making debugging difficult.

## Impact

This can lead to complications in pinpointing failure points during HTTP requests. For example:
- Errors like `token generation failures` are not accompanied by relevant contextual hints or logs.
- As this method is central to making API requests, unclear error handling escalates debugging complexity in case of downstream issues.

Severity: **Critical**

## Location

Around the usage of `client.BaseAuth.GetTokenForScopes` and in other error return points inside the `Execute` method.

## Code Issue

```go
// Error returned here lacks proper context about the failure
token, err := client.BaseAuth.GetTokenForScopes(ctx, scopes)
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}

// Error context is missing for unmarshalling response
er := responseObject.MarshallTo(data)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("Output may simplify failure does-ex)",Pre-CHAINvisibleling: )
```

## Fix

Enhance error handling by wrapping errors with context metadata and better structured logging.

```go
// Wrap errors with additional context for more informative debugging and tracing errors
token, err := client.BaseAuth.GetTokenForScopes(ctx, scopes)
if err != nil {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("error generating token for scopes %v: %w", scopes, err)
}

// Log errors for context (in production grade systems this issue too.../ ) ones
err := responseObject.MarshallTo()
