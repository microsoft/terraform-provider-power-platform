# Title

Improper handling of HTTP client response in `getAssertion` method.

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/api/auth.go

## Problem

The `getAssertion` method directly uses `http.DefaultClient.Do(req)` to make HTTP requests. However, the method does not set any timeout or retry policy to handle network issues or service unavailability.

## Impact

Using `http.DefaultClient` without restricting timeouts can make the application vulnerable to hanging indefinitely if the server does not respond. This may lead to resource exhaustion or denial-of-service scenarios. Severity: **critical**.

## Location

The issue appears in the `getAssertion` method, within `/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/api/auth.go`.

## Code Issue

```go
	resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("getAssertion: cannot request token: %v", err)
	}
```

## Fix

Introduce an `http.Client` instance with appropriate timeout settings to ensure that HTTP calls are resilient and responsive.

```go
	// Define an HTTP client with a timeout setting
	client := &http.Client{
		Timeout: 30 * time.Second, // Example timeout duration
	}

	resp, err := client.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("getAssertion: cannot request token: %v", err)
	}
```
Explanation:
- Using a custom `http.Client` allows us to enforce timeouts and handle retries more effectively.
- It ensures that the application doesn't hang indefinitely, improving reliability and stability.
