# Title  
Missing Error Handling in `PlanModifyObject` Method  

## Path to the file  
`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/modifiers/require_replace_object_to_empty_modifier.go`  

## Problem  
The `PlanModifyObject` method does not perform error handling for potential issues that might occur during its execution. For example, there is no validation to ensure that `req.StateValue` or `req.PlanValue` are non-nil before accessing their properties such as `.IsNull()` or `.Attributes()`.  

## Impact  
If `req.StateValue` or `req.PlanValue` is nil, accessing `.IsNull()` or `.Attributes()` will lead to a runtime panic, causing the program to crash unexpectedly. This creates a critical flaw in the program, as runtime crashes could occur in production environments.  

### Severity: Critical  

## Location  
The issue resides in the `PlanModifyObject` function:  

## Code Issue  

```go
func (d *requireReplaceObjectToEmptyModifier) PlanModifyObject(ctx context.Context, req planmodifier.ObjectRequest, resp *planmodifier.ObjectResponse) {
	if req.StateValue.IsNull() && req.PlanValue.IsNull() {
		return
	}

	// we only replace is object was created and is being set to empty/nil now.
	if !req.StateValue.IsNull() && (req.PlanValue.Attributes() == nil || len(req.PlanValue.Attributes()) == 0) {
		resp.RequiresReplace = true
	}
}
```  

## Fix  

Add validation checks to ensure `req.StateValue` and `req.PlanValue` are non-nil before invoking methods on them.  

```go
func (d *requireReplaceObjectToEmptyModifier) PlanModifyObject(ctx context.Context, req planmodifier.ObjectRequest, resp *planmodifier.ObjectResponse) {
	if req.StateValue == nil || req.PlanValue == nil {
		// Log or handle error appropriately
		return
	}

	if req.StateValue.IsNull() && req.PlanValue.IsNull() {
		return
	}

	// we only replace if object was created and is being set to empty/nil now.
	if !req.StateValue.IsNull() && (req.PlanValue.Attributes() == nil || len(req.PlanValue.Attributes()) == 0) {
		resp.RequiresReplace = true
	}
}
```  

This addition will prevent runtime panics by ensuring that non-nil checks are performed before accessing the attributes of `req.StateValue` and `req.PlanValue`.
