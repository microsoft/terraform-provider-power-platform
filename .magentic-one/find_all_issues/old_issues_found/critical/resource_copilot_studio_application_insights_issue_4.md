# Title
Incorrect Usage of 'ProviderData' in Configure Method

##

/internal/services/copilot_studio_application_insights/resource_copilot_studio_application_insights.go

## Problem

In the `Configure` method, the `ProviderData` is cast to `*api.ProviderClient` without checking its type. Even though there's an error added to diagnostics when the type is incorrect, further execution relies on the state of `ProviderData`. This can result in runtime panics or undefined behavior if the type is invalid.

## Impact

- Potential runtime panics due to invalid `ProviderData` type.
- Risk of undefined behavior and corrupt application state during configuration.
- Can affect provisioning and validation heavily.
- Severity: Critical

## Code Issue

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
        fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
    )
    return
}

r.CopilotStudioApplicationInsightsClient = newCopilotStudioClient(client.Api)
```

## Fix

Add an explicit nil check after casting and ensure no further execution occurs if `ProviderData` is invalid.

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok || client == nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
        fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
    )
    return
}

r.CopilotStudioApplicationInsightsClient = newCopilotStudioClient(client.Api)
```
