# Title

Avoid Hardcoding UUID Values

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/constants/constants.go

## Problem

The hardcoding of UUID values like `ZERO_UUID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"` can create maintenance issues and hinder scalability. It is difficult to determine the source and use of the value, which might need changes based on future requirements.

## Impact

Hardcoded values reduce the flexibility of the codebase and introduce potential errors during refactoring or extension. Moreover, managing such values across a large codebase becomes more complicated. Severity: Critical.

## Location

Line: `const ZERO_UUID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"`

## Code Issue

Here is the code segment where hardcoding of UUID is identified:

```go
const ZERO_UUID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

## Fix

Refactor the constant to use a UUID generation utility or provide references to where the value is used, with appropriate comments for usage clarity.

```go
import "github.com/google/uuid"

// Generate UUID dynamically or refer directly to a static UUID source, if necessary.
const ZERO_UUID = uuid.Nil.String()
```

This ensures that the UUID is sourced from a recognized library, improving readability and maintainability.
