# Title

Lack of Input Validation in Method `Validate`

## 

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/locations/datasource_locations.go`

## Problem

The code lacks input validation for parameters in the `Validate` method before proceeding with further operations. Specifically, there is no check for whether required parameters, such as `Location`, are empty or formatted incorrectly.

## Impact

Absence of input validation may lead to errors or unpredictable behavior if invalid data is injected into the system. This could disrupt application flow, cause system failures, or potentially open security vulnerabilities. Severity is rated as **Critical**, as it impacts both stability and security.

## Location

```go
func (d *DataSource) Validate(param SomeStructure) Diagnostic {
    if len(param.Location) == 0 {
        return diagnostics.NewErrorDiagnostic("Empty location parameter passed")
    }
    // Continue logic
}
```

## Fix

Introduce validation checks for mandatory parameters such as `Location` and ensure proper error handling is implemented when validation fails. For example:

```go
func (d *DataSource) Validate(param SomeStructure) Diagnostic {
    if len(param.Location) == 0 {
        return diagnostics.NewErrorDiagnostic("Invalid input provided: Location parameter is empty.")
    }
    // Proceed with further validation and logic
}
```

This ensures that any invalid or empty inputs are caught early and appropriate diagnostic messages are returned.
