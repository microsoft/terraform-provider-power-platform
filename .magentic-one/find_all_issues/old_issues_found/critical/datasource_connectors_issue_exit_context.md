# Title

Improper Use of `defer exitContext()`

## Path

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connectors/datasource_connectors.go

## Problem

The function `helpers.EnterRequestContext` creates a resource or alters a context, which may need consistent cleanup via `defer exitContext()`. However, the use of `defer exitContext()` without contextual validation or error handling can result in improper context handling under certain conditions.

Specific concern:
- Without validating when `helpers.EnterRequestContext` fails or returns an invalid `ctx` or `exitContext`, the deferred call to `exitContext()` could behave unpredictably.

## Impact

The impact is high due to the potential for memory/resource leaks or incorrect context handling during request lifecycles. This could affect service reliability and performance in scenarios involving large-scale operations or high concurrency.

Severity: **Critical**

## Location

All uses of `defer exitContext()`:
- Line 36, `Metadata` function
- Line 45, `Metadata` function
- Line 98, `Configure` function
- Line 118, `Read` function

## Code Issue

Example of problematic code:

```go
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, d.TypeInfo, req)
defer exitContext()
```

## Fix

Introduce validation for `exitContext` returned by `helpers.EnterRequestContext`. Ensure proper handling in cases where `exitContext` is not valid (e.g., `nil`):

```go
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, d.TypeInfo, req)
if exitContext == nil {
    // Handle error or log invalid exit context
    resp.Diagnostics.AddWarning("Invalid Exit Context", "The context returned from EnterRequestContext does not have a valid exit context.")
    return
}
defer exitContext()
```

This approach ensures that potential resource cleanup failures are logged and handled appropriately.
