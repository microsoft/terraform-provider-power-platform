# Title

Improper Error Handling in Unit Test

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/datasource_environment_application_packages_test.go

## Problem

In the 'TestUnitEnvironmentApplicationPackagesDataSource_Validate_No_Dataverse' unit test, there is an expectation for an error message when Dataverse does not exist in the environment. This setup lacks robust mechanisms to verify the accuracy and specificity of the error message. This results in the use of a general regular expression for matching the error, which might lead to overlooking critical discrepancies in the error message.

## Impact

Failure to verify the specificity of error messages can lead to undetected issues or incomplete validations during testing. Errors may pass undetected during testing or lead to false positives. This issue impacts both the maintainability and reliability of the test suite.

Severity: **Critical**

## Location

File: datasource_environment_application_packages_test.go
Function: TestUnitEnvironmentApplicationPackagesDataSource_Validate_No_Dataverse
Code: 
```go
ExpectError: regexp.MustCompile("No Dataverse exists in environment")
```

## Code Issue

```go
ExpectError: regexp.MustCompile("No Dataverse exists in environment")
```

## Fix

To fix this issue, the test should validate the exact error message returned by the code, ensuring its specificity and clarity. This can be achieved by comparing the error message directly as well as using more precise validation techniques.

```go
ExpectError: func(err error) bool {
    return err != nil && strings.Contains(err.Error(), "No Dataverse exists in environment")
},
```

Here, we verify that the error message contains the required string. This approach avoids false positives and ensures more robust error handling.
