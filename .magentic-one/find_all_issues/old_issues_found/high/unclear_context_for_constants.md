# Title

Unclear Context for Constants â€“ Lack of Documentation Comments

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_group_rule_set/constants.go`

## Problem

Although the file contains many constants, there are no descriptive comments or documentation to explain the purpose or usage of these constants. For example, it is unclear what `CAN_SHARE_WITH_SECURITY_GROUPS` or `SOLUTION_CHECKER_RULE_OVERRIDES` refer to without proper documentation.

## Impact

- **Severity**: High  
  Lack of documentation reduces code readability and makes it difficult for developers working on new features or debugging existing ones to understand the context and purpose of these constants. It can slow down the development process and lead to misuse of constants.

## Location

Throughout the file, such as in the following example:

```go
const (
	CAN_SHARE_WITH_SECURITY_GROUPS     = "CanShareWithSecurityGroups"
	IS_GROUP_SHARING_DISABLED          = "IsGroupSharingDisabled"
	MAXIMUM_SHARE_LIMIT                = "MaximumShareLimit"
)
```

## Code Issue

Constants like the following lack documentation to explain their context:

```go
const (
	CAN_SHARE_WITH_SECURITY_GROUPS     = "CanShareWithSecurityGroups"
	IS_GROUP_SHARING_DISABLED          = "IsGroupSharingDisabled"
	MAXIMUM_SHARE_LIMIT                = "MaximumShareLimit"
)
```

## Fix

Add informative comments above each constant or constant group to describe their purpose and context, ensuring better readability:

```go
// Security group sharing options for managing permissions
const (
	// Indicates whether sharing with security groups is allowed
	CAN_SHARE_WITH_SECURITY_GROUPS     = "CanShareWithSecurityGroups"
	// Specifies if group sharing has been disabled
	IS_GROUP_SHARING_DISABLED          = "IsGroupSharingDisabled"
	// Denotes the maximum number of shares allowed
	MAXIMUM_SHARE_LIMIT                = "MaximumShareLimit"
)
```
