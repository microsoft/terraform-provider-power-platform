# Title

Unclear Definition of `ListDataSourceModel`

## Path

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connectors/datasource_connectors.go

## Problem

The variable `state` is of type `ListDataSourceModel`, but `ListDataSourceModel` is neither defined nor imported in the analyzed file. This introduces ambiguity and makes it hard to ascertain the data structure being processed.

Unclear or missing definitions can lead to runtime errors, compilation errors, or unexpected behaviors, especially as the code tries to interact with `state`.

## Impact

High: This unclear reference can lead to errors and block the compilation or execution of the program. If `ListDataSourceModel` is defined outside this file, it is crucial to ensure proper imports. Developers working on this file may also face difficulty understanding the structure and behavior of `state`.

Severity: **High**

## Location

Line 120 in the `Read` function.

## Code Issue

```go
var state ListDataSourceModel
```

## Fix

Ensure `ListDataSourceModel` is properly defined and imported. If it exists in another package, import it explicitly at the top of the file. Example fix could look like:

1. If it exists in the `models` package:
```go
import "github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/models"
```

2. If it was meant to be defined in this file or is missing:
```go
type ListDataSourceModel struct {
    Connectors []ConnectorModel `json:"connectors"`
}

// Define ConnectorModel if not already done
type ConnectorModel struct {
    ID          string `json:"id"`
    Name        string `json:"name"`
    DisplayName string `json:"display_name"`
    Type        string `json:"type"`
    Description string `json:"description"`
    Tier        string `json:"tier"`
    Publisher   string `json:"publisher"`
    Unblockable bool   `json:"unblockable"`
}
```

Defining or importing `ListDataSourceModel` ensures that there isn't an undefined type causing runtime or compilation problems.
