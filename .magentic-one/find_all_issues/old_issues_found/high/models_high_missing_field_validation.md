# Issue Found: Missing Validation for Struct Fields

## Severity
High

## File
`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_wave/models.go`

## Problem
The struct `ResourceModel` and other similar data structures do not have any validation logic for their fields. For example, `Id` and `EnvironmentId` are crucial identifiers that should likely never be empty. However, their definition lacks constraints or validators.

## Impact
This can result in runtime errors, mismanagement of data, or invalid states in operations that rely on these structs. Such errors can be challenging to debug and may propagate through end-user systems unnoticed, especially if deployed in production environments.

## Code Example
Example from `ResourceModel`:

```go
type ResourceModel struct {
	Id            types.String   `tfsdk:"id"`
	EnvironmentId types.String   `tfsdk:"environment_id"`
	FeatureName   types.String   `tfsdk:"feature_name"`
	State         types.String   `tfsdk:"state"`
	Timeouts      timeouts.Value `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
}
```

## Recommendation
Introduce field validation checks either during instantiation or at runtime. Validators ensure fields comply with expected formats, ranges, and non-null constraints.

### Fixed Code Example:
```go
type ResourceModel struct {
	Id            types.String   `tfsdk:"id" validate:"required"` // Ensure mandatory field
	EnvironmentId types.String   `tfsdk:"environment_id" validate:"required"`
	FeatureName   types.String   `tfsdk:"feature_name"`
	State         types.String   `tfsdk:"state"`
	Timeouts      timeouts.Value `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
}

// Example Validation Function
func ValidateResourceModel(model ResourceModel) error {
	if model.Id.IsNull() {
		return fmt.Errorf("ResourceModel.Id must not be empty")
	}
	if model.EnvironmentId.IsNull() {
		return fmt.Errorf("ResourceModel.EnvironmentId must not be empty")
	}
	// Add additional checks as needed
	return nil
}
```
