# Title

Incorrect Random Number Generator Package Usage

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/copilot_studio_application_insights/resource_copilot_studio_application_insights_test.go`

## Problem

The code imports and uses `math/rand/v2`, which is not a standard Go library for random number generation. This may lead to compatibility issues or unintended behavior. Standard `math/rand` should be used unless there is a specific requirement for an alternative package.

## Impact

- **Severity:** High
- May cause execution errors or undefined behavior due to non-standard package usage.
- Reduces codebase maintainability and alignment with Go standards.

## Location

Line 5 (Import Statement).

## Code Issue

```go
	"math/rand/v2"
```

## Fix

Replace `math/rand/v2` with the standard Go `math/rand` package.

```go
	// Replace with standard library
	import (
		"math/rand"
	)
```
