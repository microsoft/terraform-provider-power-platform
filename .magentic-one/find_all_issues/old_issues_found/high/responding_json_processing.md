# Title

Improper Error Handling in API Response Processing

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_templates/api_environment_templates.go

## Problem

The `HttpResponse.Body` is being closed after the API call is made, but there is no check for whether the response body was successfully handled before closure. If any error occurs before processing the body, the closure may lead to resource-leak issues.

Moreover, the handling logic after the `json.Unmarshal` does not provide detailed context for errors from the API or JSON unmarshalling issues, making it harder to debug problems in production.

## Impact

1. Resource leakage.
2. Difficulty in debugging due to lack of contextual error messages.

Severity: High

## Location

In the implementation of `GetEnvironmentTemplatesByLocation`.

## Code Issue

Issues present in:

```go
	defer response.HttpResponse.Body.Close()

	err = json.Unmarshal(response.BodyAsBytes, &templates)

	if err != nil {
		return templates, err
	}
```

## Fix

Improve error handling and ensure that we add contextual information to errors from JSON unmarshalling. Also, ensure the closure of the body is tied to successfully obtaining it.

```go
	defer func() {
		if response != nil && response.HttpResponse != nil {
			response.HttpResponse.Body.Close()
		}
	}()

	err = json.Unmarshal(response.BodyAsBytes, &templates)

	if err != nil {
		return templates, fmt.Errorf("error during JSON Unmarshal of response body for location %s: %v", location, err)
	}
```
