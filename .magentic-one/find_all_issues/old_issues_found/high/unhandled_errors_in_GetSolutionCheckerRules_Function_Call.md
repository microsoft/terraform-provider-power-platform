# Title

Unhandled Errors in "GetSolutionCheckerRules" Function Call

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution_checker_rules/datasource_solution_checker_rules.go

## Problem

In the `Read` function, the call to `d.SolutionCheckerRulesClient.GetSolutionCheckerRules` directly raises an error but doesn't provide sufficient context about the error's source. The error message returned seems generic, and the lack of enrichment compromises debugging and user understanding.

## Impact

- **Severity**: High
The impact on debugging and error reporting is significant. Without precise context, tracing errors becomes difficult for both developers and users of the Terraform provider.
- Poor error diagnostics make troubleshooting harder. This degrades user experience and increases the support overhead.

## Location

The issue was found in the `Read` method in the following block:

## Code Issue

```go
rules, err := d.SolutionCheckerRulesClient.GetSolutionCheckerRules(ctx, environmentId)
if err != nil {
	resp.Diagnostics.AddError(fmt.Sprintf("Client error when reading %s", d.FullTypeName()), err.Error())
	return
}
```

## Fix

Enhance the error handling by enriching the error message with context regarding the `environmentId` and the operation being executed ("retrieving solution checker rules").

```go
rules, err := d.SolutionCheckerRulesClient.GetSolutionCheckerRules(ctx, environmentId)
if err != nil {
	resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
		"Failed to Fetch Solution Checker Rules", 
		fmt.Sprintf("Error retrieving solution checker rules for environment ID %s: %s", environmentId, err.Error()),
	)
	return
}
```

This improvement ensures that users are provided with sufficient context regarding the error, improving debugging capability and overall user experience.
