# Title

Usage of Deprecated Package `math/rand/v2`

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/resource_billing_policy_test.go

## Problem

The code imports the `math/rand/v2` package, which is deprecated. This version of `rand` is no longer maintained and could induce potential compatibility issues or cause unexpected behavior. The standard `math/rand` package should be used.

## Impact

Using a deprecated library can lead to unexpected bugs, compatibility problems, and difficulty in maintaining the codebase. Severity: High.

## Code Issue

```go
import (
    "math/rand/v2"
)
```

## Fix

Replace the import of `math/rand/v2` with `math/rand`. Update any usage of the old package to match the standard package API.

```go
import (
    "math/rand"
)
```

Ensure that any functions specific to `math/rand/v2` are updated accordingly to align with `math/rand`. This resolves compatibility concerns and ensures proper functionality moving forward.
