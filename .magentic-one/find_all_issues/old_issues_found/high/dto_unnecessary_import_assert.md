# Title

Unnecessary import of `assert` from `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert`

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_group_rule_set/dto.go

## Problem

The `assert` package from `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` is imported but used in a production code environment improperly. This type of import is typically used in unit tests, and having it here may indicate that assertions are being used for validation in runtime code, which is inappropriate.

## Impact

- Using testing utilities in production code reduces the runtime safety of the application.
- Makes the production code harder to maintain and debug.
- Might lead to unintended consequencesâ€”assert failures without structured error handling or messages could potentially crash the application.

Severity: High

## Location

The file imports `assert`:

```go
import (
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)
```

Usage examples:

```go
assert.Equal(nil, AI_GENERATIVE_SETTINGS, dto.Type, fmt.Sprintf("Type should be %s", AI_GENERATIVE_SETTINGS))
```

## Fix

Remove the `assert` dependency. Replace its usage with explicit error handling to ensure better readability, reliability, and runtime behavior.

```go
if AI_GENERATIVE_SETTINGS != dto.Type {
    log.Printf("Unexpected Type: expected %s but found %s", AI_GENERATIVE_SETTINGS, dto.Type)
    return errors.New("type assertion failed")
}
```

This approach is less error-prone in production and aligns with best practices for runtime code.
