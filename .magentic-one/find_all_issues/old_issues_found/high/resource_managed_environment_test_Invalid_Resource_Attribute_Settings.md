# Missing Error Checks for Invalid Resource Attribute Settings

## Severity: High

### Location
File: `resource_managed_environment_test.go`
Function: `TestAccManagedEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Create`

### Description
The test steps within the function focus exclusively on scenarios with valid configurations and expected successful creation of the resource. However, it fails to test scenarios where invalid or unexpected values for resource attributes are provided. Failure to validate error scenarios undermines the robustness of the tests and could allow edge cases to break production.

### Impact
- Lack of thorough coverage for error scenarios reduces confidence in the reliability of the codebase.
- Critical bugs in validation logic could remain undetected.

### Recommended Fix
Include additional test steps to validate the handling of invalid configurations, ensuring appropriate error messages are returned and the resource does not get created.

### Examples of Fix
Add an additional step to the test:
```go
{
    Config: `
        resource "example_resource" "test" {
            invalid_attribute = "unexpected_value"
        }
    `,
    ExpectError: regexp.MustCompile("expected error message for invalid_attribute"),
},
```
