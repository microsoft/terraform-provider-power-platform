# Issue: Overwriting Path in URL Parsing Without Verification

## Problem
The path reassignment in `GetAnalyticsDataExport` does not currently verify whether `apiUrl.Path` holds a valid value. This might cause unexpected errors or silently overwrite the correct paths.

## Impact
High Severity: Could cause silent errors or incorrect endpoint targeting during runtime.

## Affected Code
```go
apiUrl.Path = "api/v2/connections"
```

## Recommended Fix
Include explicit checks before modifying the `Path` property of `apiUrl`:

### Example Solution:
```go
if apiUrl.Path == "" {
	apiUrl.Path = "api/v2/connections"
} else if apiUrl.Path != "expected/path" {
	// Handle unexpected cases
	return nil, fmt.Errorf("unexpected path in analytics URL found: %s", apiUrl.Path)
}
```
