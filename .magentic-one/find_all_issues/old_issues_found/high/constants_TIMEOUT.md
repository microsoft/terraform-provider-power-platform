# Title

Improper Usage of Timeout Value Representation

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/constants/constants.go

## Problem

The timeout value `DEFAULT_RESOURCE_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_IN_MINUTES` is represented using a combination of `time.Minute` which could mislead the reader into thinking that a minute is being multiplied directly when in reality it is multiplied by 20.

## Impact

This representation can cause confusion and misinterpretation during debugging or refactoring. It is not intuitive to understand that `20 * time.Minute` signifies a timeout interval of 20 minutes. Severity: High.

## Location

Line: 

```go
const DEFAULT_RESOURCE_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_IN_MINUTES = 20 * time.Minute
```

## Code Issue

Here is the problematic implementation:

```go
const DEFAULT_RESOURCE_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_IN_MINUTES = 20 * time.Minute
```

## Fix

Change the constant's name to be more precise and utilize comments to clarify the measurement. This improves code readability and transforms the ambiguous usage into something self-explanatory.

```go
// Timeout value for resource operations is set to 20 minutes
// The value is represented as 1200000000000 nanoseconds (20 minutes in time.Duration)
const RESOURCE_OPERATION_TIMEOUT = time.Duration(20) * time.Minute
```
