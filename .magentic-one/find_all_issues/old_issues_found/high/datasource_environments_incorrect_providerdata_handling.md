# Title
Incorrect handling of unexpected `ProviderData` type

##
/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/datasource_environments.go

## Problem

In the `Configure` method, the code assumes a specific type for `req.ProviderData` without proper validation, and handles all mismatches by informing the user to contact the provider developers. This approach fails to address the type mismatch in a meaningful way or provide remediation.

## Impact
This could lead to runtime failures when the type of `ProviderData` does not match expectations, without the code attempting to recover or provide more actionable debugging information. It affects reliability and maintainability.

Severity: High

## Location

```go  
func (d *EnvironmentsDataSource) Configure(ctx context.Context, req datasource.ConfigureRequest, resp *datasource.ConfigureResponse) {
    ...
    client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
    if !ok {
        resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
            "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
            fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
        )
        return
    }
    d.EnvironmentClient = NewEnvironmentClient(client.Api)
}
```

## Fix

Introducing a fallback mechanism or remediation logic is crucial to prevent failures caused by mismatched types. Modify the code to handle unexpected types more flexibly. Below is an example fix:

```go  
func (d *EnvironmentsDataSource) Configure(ctx context.Context, req datasource.ConfigureRequest, resp *datasource.ConfigureResponse) {
    ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, d.TypeInfo, req)
    defer exitContext()

    if req.ProviderData == nil {
        // ProviderData will be null when Configure is called from ValidateConfig. It's ok.
        return
    }

    client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
    if !ok {
        switch v := req.ProviderData.(type) {
        case *SomeOtherTypeYouDefine:
            // Attempt to use fallback
            client = NewProviderClientFromOther(v)
        default:
            resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
                "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
                fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please make sure the configuration is valid.", req.ProviderData),
            )
            return
        }
    }
    d.EnvironmentClient = NewEnvironmentClient(client.Api)
}
```

Explanation:

1. Handles null `ProviderData` gracefully.  
2. Provides a fallback or remediation steps if the expected type mismatch occurs.  
3. Provides detailed diagnostics information with steps to resolve issues instead of redirecting users to developers.

The corrected code improves usability, reduces runtime failures, and fosters maintainability.
