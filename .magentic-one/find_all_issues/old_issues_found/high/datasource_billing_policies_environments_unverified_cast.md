# Title

Unverified cast for `req.ProviderData`

### 

/`internal/services/licensing/datasource_billing_policies_environments.go`

### Problem

The cast of `req.ProviderData` to `*api.ProviderClient` at line 76 (`client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)`) is not accompanied by definite checks to ensure the correctness of the `req.ProviderData`.

### Impact

- May lead to runtime errors in case `req.ProviderData` has an incompatible type.
- Severity: **High**

### Location

Line 76 (`client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)`) in the file `/internal/services/licensing/datasource_billing_policies_environments.go`.

### Code Issue

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
        resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
            "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
            fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
        )
        return
    }
```

### Fix

Refactor `Validate` function and make `req.ProviderData` a strongly checked type.

Example:

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
        resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
            "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
            fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
        )
        return
    }
```
