# Title

Problematic use of `rand.IntN()` in naming resources in tests

## Path

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/resource_billing_policy_environment_test.go

## Problem

The code uses `rand.IntN(9999)` to generate random numbers for naming resources dynamically in tests, such as resource group names. While this approach might avoid name collisions temporarily, it introduces non-deterministic behavior into the test cases, making it harder to reproduce failures consistently and verify the accuracy of the tests.

## Impact

Non-deterministic naming can lead to unpredictable behavior between test runs, making debugging and regression testing unnecessarily complicated. If two test instances accidentally generate the same name (though rare due to randomness), this might result in test failures or incorrect assertions. Severity: **High**

## Location

Here is a code snippet demonstrating the problematic usage:

### Code Issue

```go
name      = "power-platform-billing-` + mocks.TestName() + strconv.Itoa(rand.IntN(9999)) + `"
```

## Fix

The solution involves replacing the use of `rand.IntN()` with a deterministic approach that ensures consistent uniqueness across test runs. Using the built-in testing.T name or test function name concatenated with a predictable sequence (e.g., an incrementing number) provides clarity while maintaining uniqueness.

### Code Example

```go

import (
	"fmt"
)

func generateResourceName(testName string, sequence int) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("power-platform-billing-%s-%d", testName, sequence)
}

// Replace the problematic line with:
name := generateResourceName(mocks.TestName(), 1)

```

Using this approach makes the test case deterministic while ensuring names remain unique within the scope of the test environment. Adding an incrementing counter guarantees reproducibility without randomness.
