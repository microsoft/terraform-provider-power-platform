# Title

Missing Error Handling in `Update` Method

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/resource_environment_application_package_install.go

## Problem

In the `Update` method, the logic lacks proper error handling when setting the state. The code assumes the operation is always successful even if `resp.Diagnostics.Append(resp.State.Set(ctx, &plan)...)` encounters errors. This could potentially mask issues that occur during the `Set` operation.

## Impact

- Lack of error handling when setting the state can lead to inconsistencies and incorrect behavior.
- May cause silent errors that are difficult to debug or detect.
- Severity: High as maintaining state integrity is crucial.

## Location

```go
resp.Diagnostics.Append(resp.State.Set(ctx, &plan)...)
tflog.Debug(ctx, "No application have been updated, as this is the expected behavior")
```

File location: Method `Update`, observed near state setting logic.

## Code Issue

```go
resp.Diagnostics.Append(resp.State.Set(ctx, &plan)...)
tflog.Debug(ctx, "No application have been updated, as this is the expected behavior")
```

## Fix

Add a check to validate if errors were encountered during the `Set` operation and handle them explicitly.

```go
if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
    tflog.Error(ctx, "Failed to update state.")
    return
}
resp.Diagnostics.Append(resp.State.Set(ctx, &plan)...)
tflog.Debug(ctx, "No application have been updated, as this is the expected behavior")
```
