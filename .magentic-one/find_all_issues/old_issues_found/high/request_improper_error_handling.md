# Title

Improper Error Handling with HTTP Client Requests

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/api/request.go`

## Problem

The error returned by `httpClient.Do(request)` inside the `doRequest` function is simply returned without further contextual information. This can make troubleshooting difficult since there is no additional detail about the HTTP request that caused the error.

## Impact

When an error occurs during an HTTP request, the lack of contextual information makes debugging more challenging. Identifying the root cause of the issue and verifying data validity can take significantly longer. Severity: High.

## Location

Line: `apiResponse, err := httpClient.Do(request)` inside the `doRequest` function.

## Code Issue

```go
apiResponse, err := httpClient.Do(request)

resp := &Response{
    HttpResponse: apiResponse,
}

if err != nil {
    return resp, err
}
```

## Fix

Improve the error handling by wrapping the original error with additional contextual information about the request. This will help in identifying issues during debugging.

```go
apiResponse, err := httpClient.Do(request)

resp := &Response{
    HttpResponse: apiResponse,
}

if err != nil {
    return resp, fmt.Errorf("error during HTTP request to %s: %w", request.URL.String(), err)
}
```

The `%w` verb is used to wrap the original error with the formatted message, making debugging easier without losing the original error context.
