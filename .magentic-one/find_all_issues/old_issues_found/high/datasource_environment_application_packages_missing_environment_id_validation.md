# Title: Missing Validation for `EnvironmentId`

## Path to file
`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/datasource_environment_application_packages.go`

## Problem
The `Read` function does not validate whether the `EnvironmentId` is empty or invalid before proceeding with API requests. This opens the possibility of API calls being made with incorrect or empty values.

## Impact
- In case `EnvironmentId` is empty or invalid:
  - A potentially wasted API call will be made, leading to performance degradation.
  - Errors may propagate further making debugging difficult.
  - Risk of incorrect resource fetching or no resource fetched at all.

Severity: **High**

## Location
Function `Read`:
```go
state.EnvironmentId = types.StringValue(state.EnvironmentId.ValueString())
```

## Code Issue
```go
state.EnvironmentId = types.StringValue(state.EnvironmentId.ValueString())
```

## Fix
Validate whether `EnvironmentId` is empty or invalid before proceeding with API calls.

```go
if state.EnvironmentId.IsNull() || state.EnvironmentId.IsUnknown() || state.EnvironmentId.ValueString() == "" {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Invalid Environment ID",
        "The provided Environment ID is either empty or unknown. Please provide a valid Environment ID to proceed.",
    )
    return
}
state.EnvironmentId = types.StringValue(state.EnvironmentId.ValueString())
```

Explanation:
- Check whether `EnvironmentId` is "null," "unknown," or empty.
- If invalid, add a diagnostic error and return early to prevent erroneous API calls.
