# Title

Potential misuse of time-related fields without proper format and validation

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_groups/dto.go`

## Problem

The field `CreatedTime` in the `environmentGroupDto` struct is declared as a string type but lacks specification regarding expected format (e.g., ISO8601) or any validation to ensure the value adheres to a time standard. This can lead to inconsistent date and time representations being stored or transmitted.

## Impact

Misuse or inconsistencies in time-related fields can cause significant issues during data processing, such as failed parsing, misinterpretation, and errors in systems relying on date/time calculations or comparisons. This could degrade application reliability and introduce subtle bugs. **Severity: High**

## Location

Definition of `environmentGroupDto` struct.

## Code Issue

```go
type environmentGroupDto struct {
	CreatedTime string `json:"createdTime,omitempty"`
}
```

## Fix

Change the type of the `CreatedTime` field to `time.Time` from the `time` package, which provides a more robust representation of time. Also, ensure proper marshaling/unmarshaling to maintain compatibility with JSON.

```go
import (
	"time"
)

type environmentGroupDto struct {
	CreatedTime time.Time `json:"createdTime,omitempty"`
}
```

Additionally, ensure proper validation during input/output operations to enforce adherence to a specific time format (e.g., ISO8601).
