# Title

Poor Test Data Configuration Management in `TestAccBillingPoliciesEnvironmentsDataSource_Validate_Read`

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/datasource_billing_policies_environments_test.go

## Problem

The Terraform resource configuration in the `TestAccBillingPoliciesEnvironmentsDataSource_Validate_Read` function includes inline random identifiers and strings. The test uses `strconv.Itoa(rand.IntN(9999))` and dynamic properties such as `mocks.TestName()` for generating names and does not define structured or reproducible test configuration data.

This approach leads to unpredictable test setups, which makes debugging difficult, impedes determinism in testing, and can result in flakiness in CI/CD pipelines.

## Impact

The primary impact is unreliable testing due to non-deterministic configurations. This issue is high in severity because tests with unpredictable state can pass or fail inconsistently, causing wasted debugging effort and masking actual issues.

## Location

Within the `Config` section of `resource.TestCase` for `TestAccBillingPoliciesEnvironmentsDataSource_Validate_Read`.

## Code Issue

```go
Config: `
data "azapi_client_config" "current" {}

resource "azapi_resource" "rg_example" {
    type      = "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups@2021-04-01"
    location  = "East US"
    name      = "power-platform-billing-` + mocks.TestName() + strconv.Itoa(rand.IntN(9999)) + `"
}
...
`,
```

## Fix

Define stable and deterministic test data for Terraform configurations by using predefined constants or variables rather than runtime-generated random values. Here is an example of improvement:

```go
Config: `
data "azapi_client_config" "current" {}

resource "azapi_resource" "rg_example" {
    type      = "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups@2021-04-01"
    location  = "East US"
    name      = "example-resource-group"
}
...
`,
```

This fix ensures that the resource group name is consistent across test runs.
