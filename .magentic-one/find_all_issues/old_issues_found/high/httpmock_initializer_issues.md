# Title

Improper HTTP Mock Initialization

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/datasource_environment_application_packages_test.go

## Problem

In multiple functions, such as `TestUnitEnvironmentApplicationPackagesDataSource_Validate_Read` and `TestUnitEnvironmentApplicationPackagesDataSource_Validate_No_Dataverse`, the `httpmock.Activate()` and `httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()` methods are used to initialize and clean up mock HTTP responses. However, `httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()` is not always guaranteed to execute due to its placement in deferred blocks. This creates potential issues with proper cleanup when an error occurs before the deferred block is executed.

## Impact

Improper cleanup may lead to residual data or configurations that affect subsequent tests, causing them to fail or produce unreliable results. This problem critically impacts the reliability of the test suite. Severity of this issue: **High**.

## Location

File: datasource_environment_application_packages_test.go
Functions:
1. `TestUnitEnvironmentApplicationPackagesDataSource_Validate_Read`
2. `TestUnitEnvironmentApplicationPackagesDataSource_Validate_No_Dataverse`
Code:
```go
httpmock.Activate()
defer httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
```

## Code Issue

```go
httpmock.Activate()
defer httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
```

## Fix

Use a `t.Cleanup` function to ensure that `httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()` is always executed, even if an error occurs, ensuring reliable cleanup between tests.

```go
httpmock.Activate()
t.Cleanup(func() {
    httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
})
```

This ensures proper handling of cleanup tasks and increases reliability for your test suite.
