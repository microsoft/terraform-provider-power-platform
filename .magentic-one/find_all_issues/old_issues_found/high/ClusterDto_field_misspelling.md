# Title

Misspelled Field in `ClusterDto` Struct: `Catergory`

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/dto.go`

## Problem

There is a misspelling in the struct field name `Catergory` in the `ClusterDto` struct. It is highly likely that this was intended to be `Category`.

## Impact

Misspelled field names can lead to incorrect behaviors, especially when working with JSON serialization and deserialization. External systems expecting this field under the intended naming will fail to parse or interact correctly with the data structure.

**Severity:** High

## Location

Struct `ClusterDto` has the field `Catergory` defined incorrectly.

## Code Issue

```go
type ClusterDto struct {
    Catergory string `json:"category"`
}
```

## Fix

Correct the spelling of the field name and ensure consistent JSON tagging by changing `Catergory` to `Category`.

```go
type ClusterDto struct {
    Category string `json:"category"`
}
```
