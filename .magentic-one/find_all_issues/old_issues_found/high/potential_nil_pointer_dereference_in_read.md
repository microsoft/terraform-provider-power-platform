# Title

Potential nil pointer dereference for LicensingClient in `Read` method

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/datasource_billing_policies.go`

## Problem

The `LicensingClient` in the `Read` method is used without verifying whether it is `nil`. If someone misconfigures the `LicensingClient` in `Configure`, this could lead to a runtime `nil` pointer dereference.

## Impact

A nil pointer dereference would crash the application. Severity: **High**

## Location

`Read` method in `BillingPoliciesDataSource` implementation.

## Code Issue

```go
policies, err := d.LicensingClient.GetBillingPolicies(ctx)
```

## Fix

First, verify that `LicensingClient` is not `nil` before calling the `GetBillingPolicies` method.

```go
if d.LicensingClient == nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Licensing Client not configured",
        "The LicensingClient is nil, indicating that the Configure method was not called or failed. Ensure the provider configuration is correct.",
    )
    return
}

policies, err := d.LicensingClient.GetBillingPolicies(ctx)
```
