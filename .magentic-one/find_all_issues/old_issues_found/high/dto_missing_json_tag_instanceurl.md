# Title

Missing Field Definition for JSON Tag 

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution/dto.go

## Problem

The `InstanceURL` field in the `linkedEnvironmentIdMetadataDto` struct is missing a proper JSON tag. Without this tag, the field will not be serialized or deserialized in JSON operations, which might lead to incorrect or missing data.

## Impact

This issue impacts data serialization and deserialization, as the `InstanceURL` field would not be included in or retrieved from JSON payloads. This can cause runtime errors or failures when interacting with APIs that require this field. Severity: **high**.

## Location

```go
type linkedEnvironmentIdMetadataDto struct {
	InstanceURL string
}
```

## Code Issue

The current definition of the `InstanceURL` field:

```go
type linkedEnvironmentIdMetadataDto struct {
	InstanceURL string
}
```

## Fix

Add a JSON tag to the `InstanceURL` field to ensure it is properly serialized and deserialized in JSON operations.

```go
type linkedEnvironmentIdMetadataDto struct {
	InstanceURL string `json:"instanceurl"`
}
```

This ensures the field is correctly mapped to the corresponding JSON property, resolving serialization and deserialization issues.
