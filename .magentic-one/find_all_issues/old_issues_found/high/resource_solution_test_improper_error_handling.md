# Title

Improper Error Handling for File Operations

## File Path

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution/resource_solution_test.go

## Problem

In multiple places in the code, error handling while using `os.ReadFile` and `os.WriteFile` lacks robustness. While the testing function `t.Fatalf` ensures the test fails if an error occurs, there is no cleanup mechanism or checks for file system issues, such as disk exhaustion, file locking, or permissions. 

Examples:
1. When writing a file:
   ```go
   err = os.WriteFile(SOLUTION_1_NAME, solutionFileBytes1, 0644)
   if err != nil {
       t.Fatalf("Failed to write solution file: %v", err)
   }
   ```

2. When reading a file:
   ```go
   solutionFileBytes1, err := os.ReadFile(SOLUTION_1_RELATIVE_PATH)
   if err != nil {
       t.Fatalf("Failed to read solution file: %v", err)
   }
   ```

## Impact

This issue may lead to partially written or corrupt files that affect subsequent test runs when the errors involve resources external to the program, such as insufficient disk space or permissions. It reduces the reliability and determinism of the tests, which is critical for test-driven projects.

Severity: **High**

## Location

This problem occurs throughout the test file where `os.ReadFile` and `os.WriteFile` are used without sufficient cleanup or handling.

## Code Issue

Below is an example of the code where this issue occurs:

```go
solutionFileBytes1, err := os.ReadFile(SOLUTION_1_RELATIVE_PATH)
if err != nil {
    t.Fatalf("Failed to read solution file: %v", err)
}

err = os.WriteFile(SOLUTION_1_NAME, solutionFileBytes1, 0644)
if err != nil {
    t.Fatalf("Failed to write solution file: %v", err)
}
```

## Fix

Introduce a cleanup mechanism to handle incomplete operations. Wrap file operations in a helper function that includes proper recovery mechanisms, checks for existing stale files, and ensures cleanup of resources in case of errors:

```go
func safeFileWrite(fileName string, data []byte) error {
    tempFileName := fileName + ".temp"

    // Write to a temporary file first
    if err := os.WriteFile(tempFileName, data, 0644); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("Failed to write temporary file: %v", err)
    }

    // Rename the temporary file to the actual file
    if err := os.Rename(tempFileName, fileName); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("Failed to finalize file write: %v", err)
    }

    return nil
}

// Usage in the test
err = safeFileWrite(SOLUTION_1_NAME, solutionFileBytes1)
if err != nil {
    t.Fatalf("File writing error: %v", err)
}
```

This helper ensures atomic writes, reduces the chances of leftover corrupt files, and includes clear error reporting for diagnostic purposes.
