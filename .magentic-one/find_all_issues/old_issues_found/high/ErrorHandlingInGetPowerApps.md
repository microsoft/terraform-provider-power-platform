# Title

Error Handling Missing Context in `GetPowerApps` Method

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/powerapps/api_powerapps.go`

## Problem

The `GetPowerApps` function lacks context-specific error handling for the loop over environments. When iterating through environments, if an error occurs during `Execute` for one environment, the function terminates and returns the error immediately. This prevents partial results from being processed and returned for the environments that were successfully retrieved.

## Impact

- Severity: **High**
- Loss of fault tolerance: If one environment fails processing, the entire request fails, even if some environments could have been successfully fetched.
- Decrease in robustness, especially in scenarios with transient errors for specific environments.

## Location

Line: Inside `GetPowerApps`

## Code Issue

```go
for _, env := range envs {
    _, err := client.Api.Execute(ctx, nil, "GET", apiUrl.String(), nil, nil, []int{http.StatusOK}, &appsArray)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    apps = append(apps, appsArray.Value...)
}
```

## Fix

Use partial error handling to log or collect issues specific to individual environments while allowing successful results to proceed. Modify the loop to handle errors more gracefully:

```go
for _, env := range envs {
    apiUrl := &url.URL{
        Scheme: constants.HTTPS,
        Host:   client.Api.GetConfig().Urls.PowerAppsUrl,
        Path:   fmt.Sprintf("/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/scopes/admin/environments/%s/apps", env.Name),
    }
    values := url.Values{}
    values.Add("api-version", "2023-06-01")
    apiUrl.RawQuery = values.Encode()

    appsArray := powerAppArrayDto{}
    _, err := client.Api.Execute(ctx, nil, "GET", apiUrl.String(), nil, nil, []int{http.StatusOK}, &appsArray)
    if err != nil {
        // Log the specific error for the environment causing a failure
        fmt.Printf("Failed to fetch power apps for environment %s: %v\n", env.Name, err)
        continue // Skip this environment and proceed with the next
    }
    apps = append(apps, appsArray.Value...)
}
```
