# Lack of Edge Case Validation in Update Tests

## Severity: High

### Location
File: `resource_managed_environment_test.go`
Function: `TestAccManagedEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Update`

### Description
The test only focuses on updating resource attributes with valid values or minor variations. It does not validate cases where invalid or unexpected values are provided during the update, nor does it validate the behavior when attempting to update immutable attributes.

### Impact
- Potential gaps in error handling during resource updates may go unnoticed.
- The lack of comprehensive testing reduces confidence in the correctness of the update logic.

### Recommended Fix
Add additional test steps to validate edge cases during updates, such as:
- Providing invalid values for attributes.
- Attempting to update attributes that are supposed to be immutable.

### Example of Fix
Add a test step for invalid updates:
```go
{
    Config: `
        resource "example_resource" "test" {
            immutable_attribute = "new_value"  // Attempting to update an immutable attribute
        }
    `,
    ExpectError: regexp.MustCompile(".*Attribute is immutable.*"),
},
```
