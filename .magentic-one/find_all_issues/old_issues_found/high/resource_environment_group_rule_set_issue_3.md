# Title

Improper Error Handling with `EnvironmentGroupRuleSetClient`

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_group_rule_set/resource_environment_group_rule_set.go`

## Problem

In the `Configure` method, the incoming `req.ProviderData` is validated to check if it's `nil`. However, the type conversion for `client` does not adequately check for unexpected types and attempts to typecast directly. If an incorrect type is passed, the system can crash.

Current Error Handling:
```go
	client := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient).Api
	if client == nil {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
			"Unexpected Resource Configure Type",
			fmt.Sprintf("Expected *http.Client, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
		)
		return
	}
```

## Impact

- The current typecast can lead to runtime panicking if the type of `req.ProviderData` is invalid, such as if it does not contain a `ProviderClient`. This is particularly problematic for systems that expect robust error handling.
- A poorly implemented type validation may report misleading issues, reducing the user's ability to debug.

**Severity:** High

## Location

Method Name: `Configure`

## Code Issue

```go
	client := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient).Api
	if client == nil {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
			"Unexpected Resource Configure Type",
			fmt.Sprintf("Expected *http.Client, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
		)
		return
	}
```

## Fix

Wrap `req.ProviderData` in a proper type assertion block and provide a clearer error message when the type assertion fails.

```go
	clientData, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
	if !ok || clientData.Api == nil {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
			"Invalid Provider Data Type",
			fmt.Sprintf("Expected `*api.ProviderClient`, but received type `%T`. Ensure the provider is correctly configured.", req.ProviderData),
		)
		return
	}

	client := clientData.Api
	r.EnvironmentGroupRuleSetClient = NewEnvironmentGroupRuleSetClient(client, tenant.NewTenantClient(client))
```

- Provides robust error messaging with the correct context.
- Prevents runtime panics by ensuring all type checks pass explicitly before assigning values.
