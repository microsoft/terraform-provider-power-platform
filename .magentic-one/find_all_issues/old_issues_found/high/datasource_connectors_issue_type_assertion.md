# Title

Type assertion without proper type check (Potential TypeError)

## Path

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connectors/datasource_connectors.go

## Problem

In the `Configure` function, there is a type assertion `req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)` without first checking if `req.ProviderData` is not `nil` or if the type being asserted matches the expected type:

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
```

Although the `ok` check ensures the type assertion does not panic, the lack of consistent handling or explicit logging before taking further steps could result in hard-to-debug type errors.

## Impact

If `req.ProviderData` unexpectedly does not match the expected type or is `nil`, the error generated will affect diagnostics clarity, potentially complicating debugging. This issue could lead to runtime errors and diagnostics behaving inconsistently.

Severity: **High**

## Location

Line 74-79 of `Configure` function.

## Code Issue

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
        fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
    )
    return
}
```

## Fix

We can add a check that ensures `req.ProviderData` is null-checked before performing the type assertion. Additionally, we can log the type mismatch explicitly if `ok` is false, making the diagnostics more robust and providing better development feedback.

```go
if req.ProviderData == nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Nil ProviderData",
        "ProviderData is null; this may indicate an issue in the configuration or during validation.",
    )
    return
}

client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Type Mismatch in ProviderData",
        fmt.Sprintf("Type assertion failed. Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
    )
    return
}
```

This ensures proper handling of the case where `req.ProviderData` is either `nil` or has an unexpected type.
