# Title

Missed Error Handling in `ApplicationClient` Initialization

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/datasource_tenant_application_packages.go`

## Problem

While initializing the `ApplicationClient` object in the `Configure` method (`d.ApplicationClient = newApplicationClient(client.Api)`), there is no error handling to ensure that the initialization proceeds correctly. If `newApplicationClient` raises errors during initialization, they are not caught and handled.

## Impact

Uncaught errors during client initialization can lead to runtime failures or inconsistencies later in the program execution. Severity: **high**.

## Location

The following lines in the `Configure` method:

## Code Issue

```go
d.ApplicationClient = newApplicationClient(client.Api)
```

## Fix

Wrap the client initialization in error handling to capture and manage exceptions that may arise during the process.

```go
applicationClient, err := newApplicationClient(client.Api)
if err != nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Application Client Initialization Failed",
        fmt.Sprintf("Failed to initialize application client: %s", err.Error()),
    )
    return
}
d.ApplicationClient = applicationClient
```
