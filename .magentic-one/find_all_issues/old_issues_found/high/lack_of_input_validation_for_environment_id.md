# Title

Lack of Input Validation for `environment_id` Attribute

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution_checker_rules/datasource_solution_checker_rules.go

## Problem

The `environment_id` attribute is declared as a required string attribute, but there is no explicit validation to ensure its format or correctness (e.g., whether it's a valid GUID or ID format). This could lead to downstream errors if invalid input is provided, as the attribute directly influences API calls.

## Impact

- **Severity**: High
Failure to validate input exposes the provider to potential runtime errors, such as API-call failures or incorrect behavior that could confuse or mislead users.
- It also decreases the robustness of the data source and the safety of its operations.

## Location

This issue pertains to the declaration of the `environment_id` attribute in the schema definition:

## Code Issue

```go
"environment_id": schema.StringAttribute{
	MarkdownDescription: "The ID of the environment to retrieve solution checker rules from",
	Required:            true,
},
```

## Fix

Add validation logic to ensure the `environment_id` conforms to expected formats. For instance, if the ID is expected to always be a GUID, add a validation step.

```go
"environment_id": schema.StringAttribute{
	MarkdownDescription: "The ID of the environment to retrieve solution checker rules from",
	Required:            true,
	Validators: []schema.StringValidator{
		stringvalidator.RegexMatches(
			regexp.MustCompile(`^([a-f0-9]{8}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{12})$`),
			"Environment ID must be a valid GUID format",
		),
	},
},
```

This ensures invalid input can't proceed, improving reliability and avoiding preventable errors from bad input.
