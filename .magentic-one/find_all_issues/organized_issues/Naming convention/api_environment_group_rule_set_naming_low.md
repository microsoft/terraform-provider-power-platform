# Naming: Struct Type Name `Client` Is Too Generic

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_group_rule_set/api_environment_group_rule_set.go

## Problem

The struct type `Client` is overly generic. This can create confusion and naming collisions, especially within a large codebase or when referencing across packages. Good practice is to use a more context-specific name like `EnvironmentGroupRuleSetClient`.

## Impact

Negatively affects code readability, maintainability, and discoverability. Makes it hard to search for relevant client structs in the codebase. Severity: Low to Medium.

## Location

```go
type Client struct {
    Api       *api.Client
    TenantApi tenant.Client
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
type Client struct {
    Api       *api.Client
    TenantApi tenant.Client
}
```

## Fix

Rename the struct to a more meaningfully scoped name, such as `EnvironmentGroupRuleSetClient`.

```go
type EnvironmentGroupRuleSetClient struct {
    Api       *api.Client
    TenantApi tenant.Client
}

// Update constructor accordingly
func NewEnvironmentGroupRuleSetClient(apiClient *api.Client, tenantClient tenant.Client) EnvironmentGroupRuleSetClient {
    return EnvironmentGroupRuleSetClient{
        Api:       apiClient,
        TenantApi: tenantClient,
    }
}
```
