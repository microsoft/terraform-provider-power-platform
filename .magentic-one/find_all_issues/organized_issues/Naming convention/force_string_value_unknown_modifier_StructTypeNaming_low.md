# Struct type name does not follow Go naming conventions

##
/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/modifiers/force_string_value_unknown_modifier.go

## Problem

The struct `forceStringValueUnknownModifier` does not follow standard Go naming conventions for exported types (should be `ForceStringValueUnknownModifier` if it should be exported). Its unexported status is correct given the current usage (the constructor is exported instead), but the naming could be confusing in larger teams or inconsistent with other code.

## Impact

Deviating from naming conventions can decrease code readability and maintainability. It is a low severity issue but can cause confusion for future maintainers.

## Location

```go
type forceStringValueUnknownModifier struct {
}
```

## Fix

If the type should remain unexported, the naming is acceptable but should be verified for project style consistency. If the type should be exported, rename it:

```go
type ForceStringValueUnknownModifier struct {
}
```

Or clarify with a code comment if unexported is required.
