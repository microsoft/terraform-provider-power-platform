# Unnecessary and Wordy Struct Naming

##

internal/services/copilot_studio_application_insights/dto.go

## Problem

The struct names (e.g., `CopilotStudioAppInsightsDto`, `EnvironmentIdDto`, `EnvironmentIdPropertiesDto`, `RuntimeEndpointsDto`) are verbose and include the redundant `Dto` suffix. In Go, the `Dto` suffix (short for Data Transfer Object) is not typical and can be omitted for brevity and idiomatic naming, unless you need to distinguish them from other types with the same name.

## Impact

Reduces code readability and does not follow common Go idioms, which lowers maintainability and clarity. Severity: **low**.

## Location

Lines: 5, 17, 21, 26

## Code Issue

```go
type CopilotStudioAppInsightsDto struct { ... }
type EnvironmentIdDto struct { ... }
type EnvironmentIdPropertiesDto struct { ... }
type RuntimeEndpointsDto struct { ... }
```

## Fix

Remove the `Dto` suffix unless strictly necessary for type safety or disambiguation.

```go
type CopilotStudioAppInsights struct { ... }
type EnvironmentId struct { ... }
type EnvironmentIdProperties struct { ... }
type RuntimeEndpoints struct { ... }
```
