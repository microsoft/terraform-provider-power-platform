# Issue 3: Inconsistent Naming for Types

##

Path: /workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/datasource_environment_application_packages.go

## Problem

The struct `ApplicationClient client` within `EnvironmentApplicationPackagesDataSource` doesn't follow Go idiomatic naming (should be `ApplicationClient Client`). The type `client` appears to be undefined in this file, and its intended convention is unclear.

## Impact

Severity: **Medium**

This could cause confusion for maintainers and may not build correctly if `client` is not imported or properly named.

## Location

```go
type EnvironmentApplicationPackagesDataSource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	ApplicationClient client
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
type EnvironmentApplicationPackagesDataSource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	ApplicationClient client
}
```

## Fix

Assuming the correct type is `*ApplicationClient` or a correctly imported type (proper PascalCase):

```go
type EnvironmentApplicationPackagesDataSource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	ApplicationClient *ApplicationClient // or the correct type name
}
```

Ensure that the type name matches the actual type imported or defined elsewhere.
