# Title

Non-descriptive use of `ctx` and `exitContext` variable names in method bodies

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connection/resource_connection.go

## Problem

Within each method, the following pattern is frequently used:

```go
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, ...)
defer exitContext()
```

While `ctx` is a standard Go idiom for `context.Context`, the use of `exitContext` as a variable is not self-explanatory - it is actually a cleanup function, not a context type/variable. A more descriptive naming like `cleanup`, `restoreContext`, or `endContextScope` would improve readability.

## Impact

Low: Does not affect correctness, but hurts maintainability/readability for code reviewers unfamiliar with the local idiom. Using more descriptive names helps avoid confusion.

## Location

All methods that use:

## Code Issue

```go
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, ...)
defer exitContext()
```

## Fix

Use a more descriptive variable name for the cleanup function (e.g., `defer cleanup()`):

```go
ctx, cleanup := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, ...)
defer cleanup()
```

This aligns with Go conventions for deferred cleanup and makes intent explicit for future maintainers. Apply for whole codebase
