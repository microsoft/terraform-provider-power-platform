# DTO Structure Naming Inconsistency

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution_checker_rules/models.go

## Problem

The struct `ruleDto` is referenced in `convertFromRuleDto` but its actual definition is not present in the file, nor is its casing consistent with Go naming conventions. Struct names in Go that represent types should use CamelCase (e.g., `RuleDTO` or `RuleDto`) rather than `ruleDto`. This maintains idiomatic Go code and helps with readability and code navigation. The un-exported struct may also cause visibility issues if it is used in other packages.

## Impact

Misnaming or unexported struct names can lead to confusion and reduces code quality, especially for contributors unfamiliar with the codebase. Consistent and descriptive struct names improve maintainability. Severity: **medium**

## Location

```go
// Helper function to convert from DTO to Model.
func convertFromRuleDto(rule ruleDto) RuleModel {
```

## Code Issue

```go
func convertFromRuleDto(rule ruleDto) RuleModel {
```

## Fix

Rename the `ruleDto` struct to use CamelCase (`RuleDTO` or `RuleDto`) and ensure its visibility and import is handled properly.

```go
func convertFromRuleDto(rule RuleDto) RuleModel {
```
or
```go
func convertFromRuleDto(rule RuleDTO) RuleModel {
```
Ensure the definition of this struct matches the new naming.
