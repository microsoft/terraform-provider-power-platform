# Title

Minor Typo: Function Call `NewBillingPoliciesEnvironmetsDataSource` (Should be "Environments")

##

internal/provider/provider_test.go

## Problem

The function `NewBillingPoliciesEnvironmetsDataSource` contains a probable typo in "Environmets". This should likely be spelled "Environments" for consistency with other naming.

## Impact

Low. This is only a spelling/typo issue, but consistent naming is important for code understanding.

## Location

```go
licensing.NewBillingPoliciesEnvironmetsDataSource(),
```

## Fix

Update the code to use the correct spelling:

```go
licensing.NewBillingPoliciesEnvironmentsDataSource(),
```
