# Inconsistent API Endpoint Paths Between Create/Update RuleSet Methods

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_group_rule_set/api_environment_group_rule_set.go

## Problem

In `CreateEnvironmentGroupRuleSet`, the API path is:
```
/governance/environmentGroups/%s/ruleSets
```
But in `UpdateEnvironmentGroupRuleSet`, it is:
```
/governance/ruleSets/%s
```
This is inconsistent: the former is scoping under an environment group, the latter is not. If the API design requires both, then the naming and logic should clarify this. If not, this inconsistency may lead to confusion or bugs.

## Impact

Can lead to incorrect API calls, confusion for maintainers, or bugs related to wrong scoping of environment group rule sets. Severity: High if unintentional, Medium if documented/APIs are this way.

## Location

```go
    // Create
    Path: fmt.Sprintf("/governance/environmentGroups/%s/ruleSets", environmentGroupId)
    // Update
    Path: fmt.Sprintf("/governance/ruleSets/%s", environmentGroupId)
```

## Code Issue

```go
    // Create path
    Path:   fmt.Sprintf("/governance/environmentGroups/%s/ruleSets", environmentGroupId),

    // Update path
    Path:   fmt.Sprintf("/governance/ruleSets/%s", environmentGroupId),
```

## Fix

Validate with the API contract. If the endpoints are correct, document clearly why they differ. If inconsistent, align the path usage between methods:

```go
// Align path structure if appropriate, or add clear comments why they differ
Path: fmt.Sprintf("/governance/environmentGroups/%s/ruleSets", environmentGroupId)
// or
Path: fmt.Sprintf("/governance/ruleSets/%s", ruleSetId)
```
