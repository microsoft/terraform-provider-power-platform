# Title

Constant naming does not comply with Go convention

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/resource_managed_environment.go

## Problem

The constant `SOLUTION_CHECKER_RULES` uses ALL_CAPS with underscores, which is not idiomatic Go style. Go constants should be named using CamelCase (e.g., `SolutionCheckerRules`). This naming style could cause confusion for contributors who expect Go codebase conventions.

## Impact

Low. This does not affect functionality but may reduce maintainability and code health, especially for new contributors or reviewers familiar with Go best practices.

## Location

At the top of the file:

## Code Issue

```go
const SOLUTION_CHECKER_RULES = "meta-remove-dup-reg, ... web-unsupported-syntax"
```

## Fix

Rename the constant to CamelCase:

```go
const SolutionCheckerRules = "meta-remove-dup-reg, ... web-unsupported-syntax"
```
And update all references accordingly.
