# Issue with Inconsistent Naming: "ComponetType" instead of "ComponentType"

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/models.go

## Problem

In the `SolutionCheckerRuleDto` struct, the field is named `ComponetType`, which appears to be a typo. The correct spelling should be `ComponentType`. This could cause confusion for anyone consuming the JSON API or managing this struct, as the field does not accurately describe its purpose and introduces risk of inconsistent access or bugs related to misnaming.

## Impact

Incorrect naming impacts code clarity and maintainability. It can also lead to potential serialization/deserialization issues, making it harder for consumers to understand or utilize this struct. The issue severity is **low**, but addressing this improves professionalism and reduces future technical debt.

## Location

```go
type SolutionCheckerRuleDto struct {
    // ...
    ComponetType    string `json:"componetType,omitempty"`
    // ...
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
ComponetType    string `json:"componetType,omitempty"`
```

## Fix

The field name and its JSON tag should be corrected to `ComponentType`:

```go
ComponentType   string `json:"componentType,omitempty"`
```

Update references to this field everywhere in your codebase, not just in this file, to prevent mismatches between naming in code and serialized JSON data.
