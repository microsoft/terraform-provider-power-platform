# Naming Consistency and Clarity for `BillingPoliciesListDataSourceModel`

##
/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/datasource_billing_policies.go

## Problem

The struct used for storing the state within the `Read` function is named `BillingPoliciesListDataSourceModel`, which is verbose and not fully idiomatic. Go convention prefers clear, concise names (e.g., `BillingPoliciesModel` or `BillingPoliciesState`). Inconsistent or overly verbose naming impacts code clarity and maintainability.

## Impact

Low severity, but it degrades readability and makes the code harder to navigate for contributors.

## Location

Referenced on:
```go
var state BillingPoliciesListDataSourceModel
```

## Code Issue

```go
var state BillingPoliciesListDataSourceModel
```

## Fix

Rename `BillingPoliciesListDataSourceModel` to `BillingPoliciesModel` or a similarly concise and clear alternative throughout the codebase. For example:

```go
var state BillingPoliciesModel
```
and ensure the struct is renamed accordingly.
