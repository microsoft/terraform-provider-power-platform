# Table-driven Test Naming Inconsistent

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/api/client_test.go

## Problem

In the `TestUnitIsCaeChallengeResponse`, table-driven tests are used but the `name` field values are not always precise or following a clear pattern (e.g., missing error details, slight redundancy). While this is not a functional bug, inconsistent table-test names may cause confusion in interpreting failures or understanding intent, especially when tests grow or become more complex. Consistent and descriptive naming in table-driven tests helps readability and maintainability.

## Impact

Low severity; mostly affects readability and the usefulness of test output on failure.

## Location

```go
{
	name: "401 status with WWW-Authenticate header but missing insufficient_claims",
	...
},
// ...
{
	name: "Valid CAE challenge response with complex header",
	...
},
```

## Code Issue

Inconsistent test case naming style.

## Fix

Ensure test `name` fields in table-driven tests are consistently descriptive and use a common style (e.g., start with a status/condition, then mention what is being tested, optionally include expected outcome). For example:

```go
{
	name: "401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header: missing insufficient_claims",
	...
},
{
	name: "401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header: valid CAE challenge, complex header",
	...
},
```
