# Title

Naming Convention Does Not Follow Go Standards for "Url"

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/customerrors/url_format_error.go

## Problem

The type and field names use `Url` instead of the standard Go naming of `URL` (all caps), such as in `UrlFormatError` and the struct field `Url string`. According to Go conventions and the Go Code Review Comments (see: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#initialisms), initialisms should be all uppercase.

## Impact

Not following naming conventions impacts maintainability and readability, causing confusion for new maintainers and making it harder to search for similar constructs using standard names (`URL` instead of `Url`). This is a **low** severity issue but does affect professional code quality.

## Location

- Type name: `UrlFormatError`
- Struct field: `Url string`
- File: /workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/customerrors/url_format_error.go

## Code Issue

```go
type UrlFormatError struct {
	Url string
	Err error
}

func NewUrlFormatError(url string, err error) error {
	return UrlFormatError{
		Err: err,
		Url: url,
	}
}
```

## Fix

Change all occurrences from `Url` to `URL` in type names, variable names, and struct fields, and update references accordingly.

```go
type URLFormatError struct {
	URL string
	Err error
}

func NewURLFormatError(url string, err error) error {
	return URLFormatError{
		Err: err,
		URL: url,
	}
}
```

All usages in the file should be updated to follow this correction.
