# Insufficient Error Context in Returned Errors

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_wave/api_environment_wave.go

## Problem

The errors returned from the API and environment calls (such as `client.Api.Execute` and `client.environmentClient.GetEnvironment`) are returned directly without additional context or wrapping. This makes it harder to trace the origin of the error, especially in a larger codebase where similar errors might occur in multiple places.

## Impact

This can make debugging and support more challenging, as the caller has less information about where and why an error occurred. Severity: **medium**

## Location

Lines where errors are returned without context. For example:

```go
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
```

## Code Issue

```go
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
```

## Fix

Wrap errors with additional context using `fmt.Errorf` (or `errors.Wrap` if using the pkg/errors library):

```go
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to execute API call for organizations: %w", err)
	}
```

Do this for all error returns where additional context could be valuable.
