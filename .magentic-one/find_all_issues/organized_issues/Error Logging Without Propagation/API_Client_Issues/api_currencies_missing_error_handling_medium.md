# Title

Missing Error Handling for HTTP Response Body Closure

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/currencies/api_currencies.go

## Problem

The code uses `defer response.HttpResponse.Body.Close()` to close the HTTP response body, but does not check or handle an error that may occur during the closure of the body. While errors here are rare, they can be significant, especially if the body is writing to disk or involves the network. Neglecting them can lead to subtle bugs, resource leaks, or failure to capture important errors in logs.

## Impact

The impact is **Low to Medium**. In most cases, the error on closing the response body will likely not cause a visible problem, but for completeness, resource management, and troubleshooting in production systems, the error should be handled or at least logged.

## Location

Line with `defer response.HttpResponse.Body.Close()`

## Code Issue

```go
defer response.HttpResponse.Body.Close()
```

## Fix

Wrap the closure in a function and handle or log the error:

```go
defer func() {
    if cerr := response.HttpResponse.Body.Close(); cerr != nil {
        // Log the error or handle it appropriately
        // log.Printf("Error closing response body: %v", cerr)
    }
}()
```
