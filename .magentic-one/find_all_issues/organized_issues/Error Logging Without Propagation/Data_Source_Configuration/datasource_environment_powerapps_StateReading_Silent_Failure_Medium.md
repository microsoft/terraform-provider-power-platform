# Type Safety: Potential Silent Failure in State Reading

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/powerapps/datasource_environment_powerapps.go

## Problem

When reading state using `resp.State.Get(ctx, &state)`, diagnostics are appended, and the code returns if errors are present. However, there's no explicit error handling or log for what went wrong if state reading fails. This could make debugging more difficult.

## Impact

Severity: Medium  
Silent failures can make issues hard to diagnose, specially in a production environment.

## Location

```go
resp.Diagnostics.Append(resp.State.Get(ctx, &state)...)
if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
    return
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
resp.Diagnostics.Append(resp.State.Get(ctx, &state)...)
if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
    return
}
```

## Fix

Optionally, log a debug message when an error occurs or add further handling to help debugging.

```go
resp.Diagnostics.Append(resp.State.Get(ctx, &state)...)
if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
    tflog.Error(ctx, "Failed to read state for EnvironmentPowerAppsDataSource")
    return
}
```
