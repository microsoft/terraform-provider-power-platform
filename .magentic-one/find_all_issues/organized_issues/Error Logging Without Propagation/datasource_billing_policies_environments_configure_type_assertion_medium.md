# Title

Improper Error Handling: Ambiguous Type Assertion Failure

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/datasource_billing_policies_environments.go

## Problem

When asserting the type of `req.ProviderData` to `*api.ProviderClient`, the code simply adds an error to diagnostics and returns if it fails. However, it lacks any user guidance or structured logging, and provides a generic error message without any potential recovery or visibility for troubleshooting.

## Impact

This only logs the error as a diagnostic, which may not be enough to capture the underlying problem especially if the provider internals or dependencies change, possibly making troubleshooting more difficult. Proper error structuring and logging are best practice for maintainability. **Severity: Medium**

## Location

In the `Configure` method:

## Code Issue

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
	resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
		"Unexpected ProviderData Type",
		fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
	)
	return
}
```

## Fix

Enhance the error handling by providing more specific context, or add structured/error logging for further traceability, such as tflog.Error, and consider other diagnostic actions, e.g., fail fast if a critical path.

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
	tflog.Error(ctx, fmt.Sprintf(
		"Configure failed due to unexpected ProviderData type: expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T", req.ProviderData,
	))
	resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
		"Unexpected ProviderData Type",
		fmt.Sprintf(
			"Configuration failed: Expected *api.ProviderClient, but got %T. This is likely a bugâ€”please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData,
		),
	)
	return
}
```

This ensures improved logging and better communication in both diagnostics and logging outputs.

I will continue to analyze for additional issues.
