# Potential Type Safety Issue with Slices of Unvalidated Models

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/authorization/models.go

## Problem

The `SecurityRoles` field in `SecurityRolesListDataSourceModel` is a slice of `SecurityRoleDataSourceModel`, but there is no indication of validation or input sanitation for its elements. This could allow invalid or incomplete `SecurityRoleDataSourceModel` entries, as the struct is entirely public and its members are not protected.

## Impact

Inadequate validation can introduce subtle bugs, allow propagation of invalid state throughout the system, and potentially trigger failures downstream. Severity: **medium**.

## Location

```go
type SecurityRolesListDataSourceModel struct {
	Timeouts       timeouts.Value                `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
	EnvironmentId  types.String                  `tfsdk:"environment_id"`
	BusinessUnitId types.String                  `tfsdk:"business_unit_id"`
	SecurityRoles  []SecurityRoleDataSourceModel `tfsdk:"security_roles"`
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
SecurityRoles  []SecurityRoleDataSourceModel `tfsdk:"security_roles"`
```

## Fix

Introduce input validation either during assignment or by providing a constructor or validation method for `SecurityRolesListDataSourceModel` that ensures all required fields in its `SecurityRoleDataSourceModel` elements are set and valid.

```go
func (s *SecurityRolesListDataSourceModel) Validate() error {
    for i, role := range s.SecurityRoles {
        if role.RoleId.IsNull() || role.Name.IsNull() {
            return fmt.Errorf("Security role at index %d is missing required fields", i)
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```
