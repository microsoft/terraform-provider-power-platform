# Title

Ambiguity due to Implicit Custom Type Usage

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/admin_management_application/models.go

## Problem

The field `Id` in `AdminManagementApplicationResourceModel` is typed as `customtypes.UUIDValue`. The actual structure, constraints, and validation behavior of `UUIDValue` are unclear from this context, which can result in ambiguity or misuse by maintainers unfamiliar with the custom type's intent and implementation.

## Impact

If `UUIDValue` does not enforce UUID standards or is misused/undefined, it can cause data validation and consistency issues throughout the codebase. It may also decrease code clarity for new contributors. Severity: medium

## Location

Line 18, struct: `AdminManagementApplicationResourceModel`

## Code Issue

```go
type AdminManagementApplicationResourceModel struct {
	Timeouts timeouts.Value        `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
	Id       customtypes.UUIDValue `tfsdk:"id"`
}
```

## Fix

Ensure that `customtypes.UUIDValue` is properly documented and implements consistent validation for UUIDs. If not, replace it with a well-tested library implementation or implement proper validation. Additionally, referencing its intent in comments can aid code readability and maintainability.

Example:

```go
// Id represents a UUID for the resource, validated by customtypes.UUIDValue
Id customtypes.UUIDValue `tfsdk:"id"`
```

Or consider using a more established type if custom validation is not required.
