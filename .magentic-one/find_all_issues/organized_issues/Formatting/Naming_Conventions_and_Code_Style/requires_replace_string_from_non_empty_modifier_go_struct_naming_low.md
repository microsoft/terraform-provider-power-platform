# Struct Naming: Lack of Meaningful Name for `requireReplaceStringFromNonEmptyPlanModifier`

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/modifiers/requires_replace_string_from_non_empty_modifier.go

## Problem

The struct `requireReplaceStringFromNonEmptyPlanModifier` uses an excessively long and verbose name, which can lead to decreased readability and maintainability. A struct name should be concise while still giving enough information about its purpose. This specific name makes code harder to read and unnecessarily repeats information that could be derived from context or documentation.

## Impact

**Severity: Low**

Long and verbose names can hinder code readability and make maintenance harder, especially when such names are used throughout the codebase. While not a critical issue, improving naming conventions contributes to cleaner, more professional code.

## Location

```go
type requireReplaceStringFromNonEmptyPlanModifier struct {
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
type requireReplaceStringFromNonEmptyPlanModifier struct {
}
```

## Fix

Consider renaming the struct to a shorter, more meaningful name such as `replaceOnNonEmptyChangeModifier` or `replaceOnNonEmptyStringChange`. Here is an example:

```go
type replaceOnNonEmptyStringChange struct {
}
```

If you change the struct name, also update any references (including constructor function name) for consistency, such as:

```go
func ReplaceOnNonEmptyStringChangeModifier() planmodifier.String {
	return &replaceOnNonEmptyStringChange{}
}
```
This improves readability and aligns with Go naming best practices.
