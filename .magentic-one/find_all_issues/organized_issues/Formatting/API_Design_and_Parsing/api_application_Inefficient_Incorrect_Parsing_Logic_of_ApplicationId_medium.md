# Issue 4: Inefficient/Incorrect Parsing Logic of ApplicationId

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/api_application.go

## Problem

When parsing the application ID from `lifecycleResponse.CreatedDateTime`, the code splits the string by `/`, which seems semantically incorrect and unreliable, as `CreatedDateTime` usually holds a date, not an identifier in a path format.

## Impact

This issue has a **medium** severity as it could cause a runtime error (index out of range) or return the wrong value if the API changes the format, making the provider unreliable.

## Location

Within InstallApplicationInEnvironment (inside the for loop):

## Code Issue

```go
parts := strings.Split(lifecycleResponse.CreatedDateTime, "/")
if len(parts) == 0 {
    return "", errors.New("can't parse application id from response " + lifecycleResponse.CreatedDateTime)
}
applicationId = parts[len(parts)-1]
tflog.Debug(ctx, "Created Application Id: "+applicationId)
```

## Fix

Verify what property should hold the application ID based on the DTO returned by the API. If it is a field other than `CreatedDateTime`, use the dedicated property.

If this logic is correct, handle dates accordingly. Otherwise, update to access the correct property:

```go
// If the DTO contains an ApplicationId field:
if lifecycleResponse.ApplicationId == "" {
    return "", errors.New("application id not present in lifecycle response")
}
applicationId = lifecycleResponse.ApplicationId
tflog.Debug(ctx, "Created Application Id: "+applicationId)
```

Or, if you must parse, ensure robust checking:

```go
parts := strings.Split(lifecycleResponse.CreatedDateTime, "/")
if len(parts) == 0 {
    return "", errors.New("can't parse application id from response " + lifecycleResponse.CreatedDateTime)
}
applicationId = parts[len(parts)-1]
tflog.Debug(ctx, "Created Application Id: "+applicationId)
```

But document and validate why `CreatedDateTime` is being split.
