# Diagnostic Message Is Not Actionable

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/validators/make_field_required_when_other_field_does_not_have_value_validator.go

## Problem

The diagnostic error message returned when path matches are not found is not actionable or descriptive to the end user. Messages such as `"Other field required when value of validator should have exactly one match"` do not provide enough information to guide users to resolve the configuration error.

## Impact

Low severity. Affects user experience and troubleshooting, but not runtime correctness.

## Location

```go
res.Diagnostics.AddError("Other field required when value of validator should have exactly one match", "")
```

## Code Issue

```go
res.Diagnostics.AddError("Other field required when value of validator should have exactly one match", "")
```

## Fix

Improve the diagnostic messages to provide context and guidance.

```go
res.Diagnostics.AddError(
	"Validator Configuration Error: Other field match failed",
	"The validator could not uniquely locate the other field in the configuration. Ensure that 'OtherFieldExpression' matches exactly one attribute.",
)
```
