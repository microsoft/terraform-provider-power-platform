# Title

defer exitContext() may extend resource lifetimes

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/resource_managed_environment.go

## Problem

This code uses `defer exitContext()` at the top of most resource methods after entering a request context. However, since these handler methods are not always long-running (may return early on error), the defer will always execute at function return. In most cases this is fine, but in Go, if any context resources are opened/pinned, they could stay open longer than necessary (e.g., until panic or stack unwinding). This is not a memory leak, but can sometimes defer cleanup (especially in high-throughput servers or in benchmarking scenarios), causing unnecessary resource occupation. 

## Impact

Medium. In the general case, this is idiomatic and safe, but in very tight event loops or in extremely rare error/panic cases, resource holding could be longer than needed. Also, it can obscure where cleanup truly happens as code evolves/forks inside the method.

## Location

## Code Issue

```go
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, r.TypeInfo, req)
defer exitContext()
```

## Fix

For more explicit resource handling, you could opt for:
```go
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, r.TypeInfo, req)
// Instead of `defer`, explicitly call exitContext() at each early return when critical resources are involved.
```
Or review/ensure that exitContext() is always idempotent and side-effect-free if accidentally called multiple times, and that defer usage is not hiding resource pinning in complex flows.
