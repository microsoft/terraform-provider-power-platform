# Title

Misleading Error Message When ProviderData is Not *api.ProviderClient

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_settings/resources_environment_settings.go

## Problem

Within the `Configure` method, the code assumes that `req.ProviderData` is always of the type `*api.ProviderClient`. If a different type is provided, it tries to access its `Api` property which would lead to a panic. The error message in this case refers to an `*http.Client`, which is misleading and could cause confusion when debugging.

## Impact

If the ProviderData is not the expected type, this will result in a panic. The error message refers to `*http.Client`, which is misleading because the expected value is a `*api.ProviderClient`. This could lead to confusion and make debugging harder. Severity: high.

## Location

```go
func (r *EnvironmentSettingsResource) Configure(ctx context.Context, req resource.ConfigureRequest, resp *resource.ConfigureResponse) {
	ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, r.TypeInfo, req)
	defer exitContext()
	if req.ProviderData == nil {
		// ProviderData will be null when Configure is called from ValidateConfig.  It's ok.
		return
	}

	client := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient).Api

	if client == nil {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
			"Unexpected Resource Configure Type",
			fmt.Sprintf("Expected *http.Client, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
		)

		return
	}

	r.EnvironmentSettingClient = newEnvironmentSettingsClient(client)
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
	client := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient).Api

	if client == nil {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
			"Unexpected Resource Configure Type",
			fmt.Sprintf("Expected *http.Client, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
		)

		return
	}
```

## Fix

Add a type assertion check and improve the error message to clearly state the expected type.

```go
	providerClient, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
	if !ok {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
			"Unexpected Resource Configure Type",
			fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
		)
		return
	}

	client := providerClient.Api
	if client == nil {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
			"Unexpected Resource Configure Type",
			"Provider client Api is nil. Please report this issue to the provider developers.",
		)
		return
	}
```
This fix avoids a panic and produces more accurate error messages, improving error handling and developer experience.
