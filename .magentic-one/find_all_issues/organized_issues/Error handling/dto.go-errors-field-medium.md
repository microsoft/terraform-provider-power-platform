# Inconsistent Data Structure for "Errors" Field

##

internal/services/copilot_studio_application_insights/dto.go

## Problem

The field `Errors` in the `CopilotStudioAppInsightsDto` struct is currently of type `string`. However, the field name and its JSON tag (`"errors"`) strongly suggest that this should be a collection (e.g., a slice of strings) rather than a single string, since the plural implies potentially multiple errors.

## Impact

If misused (single string instead of collection), it limits error reporting and could lead to confusion, improper API contract, or data loss when marshalling/unmarshalling JSON. Severity: **medium**.

## Code Issue

```go
	Errors                      string `json:"errors"`
```

## Fix

Consider using a slice of strings if the intention is to support multiple errors. 

```go
	Errors []string `json:"errors"`
```

If only one error message is required, use the singular form for both the field and the JSON tag.

```go
	Error string `json:"error"`
```
