# Title

Interface Implementation Assertion as Value Instead of Pointer

##
/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/customerrors/url_format_error.go

## Problem

The variable `_ error = UrlFormatError{}` is used to assert that `UrlFormatError` implements the `error` interface. While this is valid if the `Error()` method has a value receiver (as in the present code), it can be a potential maintainability concern: if the receiver of `Error()` is later changed to a pointer, this assertion will no longer be valid. In most Go codebases, error types are implemented with pointer receivers to allow for more flexibility, such as mutability, and in such cases, the interface assertion should also use a pointer.

## Impact

If the receiver type changes in the future to a pointer (e.g. `func (e *UrlFormatError) Error() string`), this assertion will silently fail to assert interface satisfaction at compile time, possibly introducing errors later on. Severity is **low**, but impacts future-proofing and maintainability.

## Location

Global variable: `var _ error = UrlFormatError{}`
File: /workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/customerrors/url_format_error.go

## Code Issue

```go
var _ error = UrlFormatError{}
```

## Fix

If the receiver will always be a value receiver, leave as is. However, best practice is to implement the error interface with pointer receivers and assert interface implementation using pointer as well:

```go
var _ error = (*URLFormatError)(nil)
```

The `Error()` method would then look like:

```go
func (e *URLFormatError) Error() string {
    // implementation
}
```

This is more idiomatic for future extensibility.
