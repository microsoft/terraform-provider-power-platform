# Title

Possible nil pointer dereference if GovernanceConfiguration.Settings is nil

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/resource_managed_environment.go

## Problem

Within the Create and Update handlers, after a successful client call, the returned environment object's `env.Properties.GovernanceConfiguration.Settings` is dereferenced and fields accessed directly, assuming it is always non-nil. However, this assumption may not hold if the backend data does not provide configuration settings as expectedâ€”e.g., in freshly created environments, misprovisioned states, or certain error conditions. A nil pointer dereference would result in a panic and crash the Terraform provider process.

Though the Read handler *does* check for nil before dereferencing, both Create and Update do not, and this inconsistency represents a risk.

## Impact

High severity. A nil pointer panic will crash Terraform runs and could destroy in-progress state. The risk is particularly notable during environment churn, failures or API changes.

## Location

Example in Create and Update:

## Code Issue

```go
maxLimitUserSharing, _ := strconv.ParseInt(env.Properties.GovernanceConfiguration.Settings.ExtendedSettings.MaxLimitUserSharing, 10, 64)
plan.IsUsageInsightsDisabled = types.BoolValue(env.Properties.GovernanceConfiguration.Settings.ExtendedSettings.ExcludeEnvironmentFromAnalysis == "true")
// ... similar lines follow
```

## Fix

Check `env.Properties.GovernanceConfiguration.Settings` for nil before dereferencing:

```go
settings := env.Properties.GovernanceConfiguration.Settings
if settings == nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError("Missing GovernanceConfiguration.Settings after environment provisioning", "API response did not include configuration settings. This might indicate an API or state consistency issue. Please inspect the backend state or retry.")
    return
}
// then proceed to access settings.ExtendedSettings ...
```

Apply this check before all dereferences in the Create and Update methods.
