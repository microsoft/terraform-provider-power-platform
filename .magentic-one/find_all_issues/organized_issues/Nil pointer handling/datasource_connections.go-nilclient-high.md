# Issue: Possible nil pointer dereference for `d.ConnectionsClient` in `Read`

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connection/datasource_connections.go

## Problem

In the `Read` method, `d.ConnectionsClient` is accessed without checking if it has been properly initialized. If the `Configure` method fails to set up the client (e.g., due to invalid provider data or missing configuration), this could lead to a nil pointer dereference at runtime.

## Impact

Severity: **High**

Attempting to call a method on a nil `ConnectionsClient` would result in a runtime panic, which would terminate the provider execution and negatively impact UX as well as reliability.

## Location

```go
connections, err := d.ConnectionsClient.GetConnections(ctx, state.EnvironmentId.ValueString())
```

## Code Issue

```go
connections, err := d.ConnectionsClient.GetConnections(ctx, state.EnvironmentId.ValueString())
```

## Fix

Check whether `d.ConnectionsClient` is nil before using it, and return a diagnostic error if it is:

```go
if d.ConnectionsClient == nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Unconfigured Connections Client",
        "The connections client has not been configured. Please ensure provider configuration is correct.",
    )
    return
}

connections, err := d.ConnectionsClient.GetConnections(ctx, state.EnvironmentId.ValueString())
```
