# Title

Non-Idiomatic Type Assertion in Equal Method

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/customtypes/uuid_type.go

## Problem

In the `Equal` method, the type assertion is performed against `UUIDType` (a value type), not against a pointer (`*UUIDType`). This will fail if the `attr.Type` instance is a pointer (which is common in Go when working with interfaces). This may result in false negatives when checking equality, even if both are logically the same type.

## Impact

Severity: **Medium**

- Equality checks may erroneously return false even when types are effectively equal, leading to subtle bugs, especially as pointer/value receivers are mixed or if interface implementations are refactored.
- May cause unexpected behavior when the framework expects equality logic to work reliably.

## Location

`func (t UUIDType) Equal(o attr.Type) bool`

```go
	other, ok := o.(UUIDType)
	if !ok {
		return false
	}
```

## Code Issue

```go
	other, ok := o.(UUIDType)
	if !ok {
		return false
	}
```

## Fix

- Use pointer receivers for the method and assert to `*UUIDType`, or enhance support for both pointer and value types:

Example using pointer receiver and asserting both ways:

```go
func (t *UUIDType) Equal(o attr.Type) bool {
	other, ok := o.(*UUIDType)
	if !ok {
		return false
	}
	return t.StringType.Equal(other.StringType)
}
```

Or, support both forms:

```go
	var other *UUIDType
	switch v := o.(type) {
	case UUIDType:
		other = &v
	case *UUIDType:
		other = v
	default:
		return false
	}
	return t.StringType.Equal(other.StringType)
```
