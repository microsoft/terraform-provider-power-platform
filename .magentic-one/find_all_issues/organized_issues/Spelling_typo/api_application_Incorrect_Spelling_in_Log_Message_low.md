# Issue 1: Incorrect Spelling in Log Message

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/api_application.go

## Problem

There is a typo in the debug logging statement `"Opeartion Location Header"`; it should be `"Operation Location Header"`.

## Impact

This issue has a **low** severity. While it doesn't impact program logic or functionality directly, spelling mistakes in log messages can make logs harder to search and lead to confusion or mistakes during debugging and troubleshooting.

## Location

Line inside `InstallApplicationInEnvironment`, in the following code:

## Code Issue

```go
tflog.Debug(ctx, "Opeartion Location Header: "+operationLocationHeader)
```

## Fix

Correct the spelling of "Opeartion" to "Operation":

```go
tflog.Debug(ctx, "Operation Location Header: "+operationLocationHeader)
```
