# Issue: Misspelled struct name: `enironmentDeleteDto`

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/api_environment.go

## Problem

There is a misspelled struct name `enironmentDeleteDto` instead of the likely intended `environmentDeleteDto`. This could be confusing to maintainers and can easily lead to inconsistencies or further typos in referencing this type throughout the codebase. If this typo also occurs in the definition, it could have broader effects on code readability elsewhere.

## Impact

- Severity: Low
- This is primarily a readability and code quality issue. It does not directly cause program failures but creates confusion for future maintainers or contributors.

## Location

Line in function `DeleteEnvironment`:

```go
environmentDelete := enironmentDeleteDto{
	Code:    "7", // Application.
	Message: "Deleted using Power Platform Terraform Provider",
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
environmentDelete := enironmentDeleteDto{
	Code:    "7", // Application.
	Message: "Deleted using Power Platform Terraform Provider",
}
```

## Fix

Change all instances of `enironmentDeleteDto` to `environmentDeleteDto` to improve naming clarity.

```go
environmentDelete := environmentDeleteDto{
	Code:    "7", // Application.
	Message: "Deleted using Power Platform Terraform Provider",
}
```

And make sure the struct is defined with the correct name as well, if it exists in this package or imported.
