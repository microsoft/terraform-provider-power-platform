# Title

String-based Comparison for Role Names Instead of Constants or Enums

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/authorization/api_user.go

## Problem

In the function `GetEnvironmentUserByAadObjectId`, the code determines role assignment by comparing role names using string equality with untyped literals ("EnvironmentAdmin", "EnvironmentMaker"). If the backend changes these string literals or a typo occurs, it would result in subtle runtime errors. This approach couples logic to string values and reduces type safety.

## Impact

Severity: Low

This is mostly a maintainability and reliability issue. While it is unlikely to cause immediate failure, changes in API contract (role name typo, casing change, etc.), or misspellings, will break functionality without compiler errors and could be hard to detect.

## Location

Within GetEnvironmentUserByAadObjectId:

## Code Issue

```go
isAdminRole := roleAssignment.Properties.RoleDefinition.Name == "EnvironmentAdmin"
isMakerRole := roleAssignment.Properties.RoleDefinition.Name == "EnvironmentMaker"
```

## Fix

Define role constants or an enum-like structure for these commonly used string values, and reference those instead. Example:

```go
const (
    RoleEnvironmentAdmin = "EnvironmentAdmin"
    RoleEnvironmentMaker = "EnvironmentMaker"
)

...

isAdminRole := roleAssignment.Properties.RoleDefinition.Name == RoleEnvironmentAdmin
isMakerRole := roleAssignment.Properties.RoleDefinition.Name == RoleEnvironmentMaker
```

This enhances reliability, facilitates searchability, and limits bugs from string typos.
