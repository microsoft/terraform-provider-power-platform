# Typo in Field Name in ClusterDto

## /workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/dto.go

## Problem

There is a typo in the `ClusterDto` struct: the field `Catergory` should be spelled as `Category`. 

## Impact

This affects code readability and potentially causes confusion or bugs when interfacing this DTO with other systems, especially if JSON tags are not consistently used. It can also lead to incorrect data mapping if reflection or dynamic field access is used. Severity: **low**.

## Location

- `ClusterDto` struct definition around line 74

## Code Issue

```go
type ClusterDto struct {
    Catergory string `json:"category"`
}
```

## Fix

Rename the struct field and update all project references accordingly:

```go
type ClusterDto struct {
    Category string `json:"category"`
}
```
