# DTO Spelling and Typo Issues

This document contains all spelling and typo issues found in DTO (Data Transfer Object) files within the terraform-provider-power-platform codebase.

## ISSUE 1

### Struct Naming Typo

**File:** `/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/enterprise_policy/dto.go`

**Problem:** The struct is named `linkEnterprosePolicyDto`, but the word "Enterprose" is likely a typo for "Enterprise". Correcting this typo will improve code readability and maintainability.

**Impact:** Incorrect naming can lead to confusion, reduced maintainability, and potential difficulty when using tooling or searching the codebase. Severity: Medium

**Location:** Line defining the struct:

**Code Issue:**

```go
type linkEnterprosePolicyDto struct {
    SystemId string `json:"systemId"`
}
```

**Fix:** Rename the struct to `linkEnterprisePolicyDto` (and refactor any usage accordingly):

```go
type linkEnterprisePolicyDto struct {
    SystemId string `json:"systemId"`
}
```

## ISSUE 2

### Typo in Field Name in ClusterDto

**File:** `/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/dto.go`

**Problem:** There is a typo in the `ClusterDto` struct: the field `Catergory` should be spelled as `Category`.

**Impact:** This affects code readability and potentially causes confusion or bugs when interfacing this DTO with other systems, especially if JSON tags are not consistently used. It can also lead to incorrect data mapping if reflection or dynamic field access is used. Severity: **low**.

**Location:** `ClusterDto` struct definition around line 74

**Code Issue:**

```go
type ClusterDto struct {
    Catergory string `json:"category"`
}
```

**Fix:** Rename the struct field and update all project references accordingly:

```go
type ClusterDto struct {
    Category string `json:"category"`
}
```

## ISSUE 3

### Typo in Type Name: enironmentDeleteDto

**File:** `/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/dto.go`

**Problem:** The struct `enironmentDeleteDto` has a typo in its name, which should read `environmentDeleteDto`. Such typographical errors in type names are not idiomatic and can make code more difficult to read, discover, and reference.

**Impact:** The issue is of low severity but results in reduced code clarity, worsens searchability, and increases susceptibility to the propagation of spelling mistakes in other places.

**Location:** Line 187, type declaration

**Code Issue:**

```go
type enironmentDeleteDto struct {
    Code    string `json:"code"`
    Message string `json:"message"`
}
```

**Fix:** Rename this type to the correct spelling, and refactor all project references:

```go
type environmentDeleteDto struct {
    Code    string `json:"code"`
    Message string `json:"message"`
}
```

## ISSUE 4

### Typo in Type Name

**File:** `/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/dto.go`

**Problem:** There is a typo in the struct name `EnviromentPropertiesDto`, which should be spelled `EnvironmentPropertiesDto`. This typo is not only non-idiomatic, it can increase confusion and technical debt by spreading inconsistent spelling throughout the codebase. The misspelling also appears in field types where this struct is used.

**Impact:** This issue impacts code readability and maintainability. Developers may encounter issues when searching for environment-related code, and it can propagate errors as the typo is likely to be copy-pasted elsewhere. Severity: **low** (but can easily snowball).

**Location:**

- Type declaration around line 34
- Usage in `EnvironmentDto` struct

**Code Issue:**

```go
type EnviromentPropertiesDto struct { // typo here
    // ...
}

Properties *EnviromentPropertiesDto `json:"properties"` // typo in field type
```

**Fix:** Correct the spelling of the struct name everywhere it's used, and update the references in the codebase.

```go
type EnvironmentPropertiesDto struct {
    // ...
}

Properties *EnvironmentPropertiesDto `json:"properties"`
```

Make sure to update any imports or references throughout your project to use the corrected name.

Apply this fix to the whole codebase

# To finish the task you have to

1. Run linter and fix any issues
2. Run UnitTest and fix any of failing ones
3. Generate docs
4. Run Changie

# Changie Instructions

Create only one change log entry. Do not run the changie tool multiple times.

```bash
changie new --kind <kind_key> --body "<description>" --custom Issue=<issue_number>
```

Where:

- `<kind_key>` is one of: breaking, changed, deprecated, removed, fixed, security, documentation
- `<description>` is a clear explanation of what was fixed/changed search for 'copilot-commit-message-instructions.md' how to write description.
- `<issue_number>` pick the issue number or PR number
