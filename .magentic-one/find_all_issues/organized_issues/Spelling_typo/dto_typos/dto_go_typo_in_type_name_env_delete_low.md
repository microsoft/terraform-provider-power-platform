# Typo in Type Name: enironmentDeleteDto

## /workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/dto.go

## Problem

The struct `enironmentDeleteDto` has a typo in its name, which should read `environmentDeleteDto`. Such typographical errors in type names are not idiomatic and can make code more difficult to read, discover, and reference.

## Impact

The issue is of low severity but results in reduced code clarity, worsens searchability, and increases susceptibility to the propagation of spelling mistakes in other places.

## Location

- Line 187, type declaration

## Code Issue

```go
type enironmentDeleteDto struct {
    Code    string `json:"code"`
    Message string `json:"message"`
}
```

## Fix

Rename this type to the correct spelling, and refactor all project references:

```go
type environmentDeleteDto struct {
    Code    string `json:"code"`
    Message string `json:"message"`
}
```
