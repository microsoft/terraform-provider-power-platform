# Title

Typo in Attribute Descriptions: Markdown and Enforcement

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_group_rule_set/resource_environment_group_rule_set.go

## Problem

There are repeated typographical errors in Markdown descriptions for schema attributes (such as `MarkdownDescription: "Solution checker enforceemnt mode: none, warm, block"` and others like `"Enable AI generated description"`). These should be corrected for professionalism and clarity.

## Impact

Low.

- Minor: only documentation is affected, not code logic.
- However, typos can affect user trust and documentation usability.

## Location

Lines such as:

```go
MarkdownDescription: "Solution checker enforceemnt mode: none, warm, block",
```
and

```go
MarkdownDescription: "Agree to enable Bing search features",
```
(and others containing "enbaled", "Inculde", etc.)

## Fix

Correct the MarkdownDescriptions:

```go
MarkdownDescription: "Solution checker enforcement mode: none, warn, block",
MarkdownDescription: "Enable AI generated description",
MarkdownDescription: "Include insights for all Managed Environments in this group in weekly email digest.",
MarkdownDescription: "Agree to enable Bing search features",
```
