# Missing Error Handling for `LicensingClient` Initialization

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/datasource_billing_policies.go

## Problem

In the `Configure` method, the initialization of `NewLicensingClient` is not checked for errors. If `NewLicensingClient` were to return an error (e.g., due to a nil or invalid API client), this would not be captured and could cause panics or undefined behavior later. Although the current implementation suggests no error is returned, robust code should always account for future changes.

## Impact

This issue is a "low" severity as the current implementation of `NewLicensingClient` may not fail, but if refactored, fail-safe patterns should be in place. Not handling potential errors could lead to panics or non-obvious failures if the client is ever changed to error.

## Location

`Configure` method, line:
```go
d.LicensingClient = NewLicensingClient(client.Api)
```

## Code Issue

```go
d.LicensingClient = NewLicensingClient(client.Api)
```

## Fix

Check for error on client construction â€” if `NewLicensingClient` can return an error, it should be handled.

```go
licensingClient, err := NewLicensingClient(client.Api)
if err != nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Failed to create Licensing client",
        fmt.Sprintf("Could not initialize licensing client: %s", err.Error()),
    )
    return
}
d.LicensingClient = licensingClient
```
If the constructor cannot error, document this via comments and consider a panic/logging if the type assertion fails.
