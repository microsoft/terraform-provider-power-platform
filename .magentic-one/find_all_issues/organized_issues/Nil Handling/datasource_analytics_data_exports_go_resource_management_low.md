# Potential Performance Issue: Use of Pointers to Slices

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/analytics_data_export/datasource_analytics_data_exports.go

## Problem

The code pattern `len(*analyticsDataExport)` is used, indicating `analyticsDataExport` is a pointer to a slice:

```go
exports := make([]AnalyticsDataModel, 0, len(*analyticsDataExport))
for _, export := range *analyticsDataExport {
    if model := convertDtoToModel(&export); model != nil {
        exports = append(exports, *model)
    }
}
```

In Go, slices are already reference types. Passing and storing them as pointers to slices usually has negligible benefit, and can increase cognitive load and complexity. Unless mutation or a nil distinction is required, functions should accept and return slices directly.

## Impact

Minor performance/readability issue, as it complicates reasoning for memory ownership. Not a leak, but opportunity for simplification and clarity.

**Severity:** Low.

## Location

```go
len(*analyticsDataExport)
for _, export := range *analyticsDataExport {
```

## Code Issue

```go
analyticsDataExport, err := d.analyticsExportClient.GetAnalyticsDataExport(ctx)
// ...
exports := make([]AnalyticsDataModel, 0, len(*analyticsDataExport))
for _, export := range *analyticsDataExport {
```

## Fix

If possible, use a slice instead of pointer to slice:

```go
// In the client, return a slice, not a pointer to a slice
analyticsDataExport, err := d.analyticsExportClient.GetAnalyticsDataExport(ctx)
// ...
exports := make([]AnalyticsDataModel, 0, len(analyticsDataExport))
for _, export := range analyticsDataExport {
    if model := convertDtoToModel(&export); model != nil {
        exports = append(exports, *model)
    }
}
```
// And update the client interface as appropriate.
