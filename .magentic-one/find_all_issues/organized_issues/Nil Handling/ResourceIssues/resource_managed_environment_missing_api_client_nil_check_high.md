# Title

Missing API client nil check in newManagedEnvironmentClient

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/resource_managed_environment.go

## Problem

After extracting the Api field from ProviderClient and passing it to newManagedEnvironmentClient, there is no check in this file to ensure that the resulting ManagedEnvironmentClient is not nil (even if client.Api was non-nil). If newManagedEnvironmentClient ever returns nil, subsequent methods will panic. Currently this is unlikely, but cosmic possibilities like future changes, dependency upgrades, or insecure initialization patterns may introduce issues. Defensive API client coding often suggests nil-proofs for all client/connection bootstrapping logic.

## Impact

High. If a nil client is ever returned, all method calls and logic that use r.ManagedEnvironmentClient in resource operations will immediately panic, breaking the provider's reliability. This is considered high severity due to the crash and state risk.

## Location

In Configure:

## Code Issue

```go
r.ManagedEnvironmentClient = newManagedEnvironmentClient(clientApi)
```

## Fix

After assignment, proactively check for nil:

```go
r.ManagedEnvironmentClient = newManagedEnvironmentClient(clientApi)
if r.ManagedEnvironmentClient == nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError("ManagedEnvironmentClient initialization failed", "newManagedEnvironmentClient returned nil. This is unexpectedâ€”please report this error to the provider development team.")
    return
}
```
