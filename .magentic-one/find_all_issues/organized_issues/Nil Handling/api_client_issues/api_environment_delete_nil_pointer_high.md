# Issue: Incorrect error handling and nil pointer access in DeleteEnvironment

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/api_environment.go

## Problem

The function `DeleteEnvironment` does not always check for `err != nil` immediately after the `Api.Execute` method call. It proceeds to perform logic on the `response` object (accessing `response.HttpResponse.StatusCode`, etc.) that could be nil if an error occurs, which can cause a panic at runtime.

## Impact

- Severity: High
- Can lead to panics and crashes at runtime if `response` is nil and error is not handled immediately.
- Having incorrect error-handling logic also makes the code harder to maintain and debug.

## Location

Within the `DeleteEnvironment` function:

```go
response, err := client.Api.Execute(ctx, nil, "DELETE", apiUrl.String(), nil, environmentDelete, []int{http.StatusNoContent, http.StatusAccepted, http.StatusConflict, http.StatusNotFound}, nil)

// Handle HTTP 404 case - if the environment is not found, consider it already deleted
if response != nil && response.HttpResponse.StatusCode == http.StatusNotFound {
    tflog.Info(ctx, fmt.Sprintf("Environment '%s' not found. Treating as successfully deleted.", environmentId))
    return nil
}

if response.HttpResponse.StatusCode == http.StatusConflict {
    err := client.handleHttpConflict(ctx, response)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return client.DeleteEnvironment(ctx, environmentId)
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
response, err := client.Api.Execute(ctx, nil, "DELETE", apiUrl.String(), nil, environmentDelete, []int{http.StatusNoContent, http.StatusAccepted, http.StatusConflict, http.StatusNotFound}, nil)

if response != nil && response.HttpResponse.StatusCode == http.StatusNotFound {
    // ...
}

if response.HttpResponse.StatusCode == http.StatusConflict {
    // ...
}
```

## Fix

Check `err` immediately after the API call, and only continue if it is `nil`. Ensure `response` is not nil before dereferencing, and consolidate the error and response handling for clarity and safety.

```go
response, err := client.Api.Execute(ctx, nil, "DELETE", apiUrl.String(), nil, environmentDelete, []int{http.StatusNoContent, http.StatusAccepted, http.StatusConflict, http.StatusNotFound}, nil)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
if response == nil { // paranoid check, should not happen if err is nil, but for robustness
    return errors.New("unexpected nil response in DeleteEnvironment")
}

if response.HttpResponse.StatusCode == http.StatusNotFound {
    tflog.Info(ctx, fmt.Sprintf("Environment '%s' not found. Treating as successfully deleted.", environmentId))
    return nil
}

if response.HttpResponse.StatusCode == http.StatusConflict {
    herr := client.handleHttpConflict(ctx, response)
    if herr != nil {
        return herr
    }
    return client.DeleteEnvironment(ctx, environmentId)
}
```
