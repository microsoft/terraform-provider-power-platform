# No Coverage for Resource Import Behavior in Acceptance Tests

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/resource_environment_test.go

## Problem

There are a wide variety of acceptance test scenarios covering CRUD (create, update, delete), validation, error conditions, etc., but the file provides no concrete coverage or test scenario for verifying that resource import works as expected in terraform (i.e., importing existing Power Platform environments into state).

The lack of import tests could miss issues where import parsing or field mapping is incorrect, or where drift manifests upon re-running plan/apply after import.

## Impact

- **Severity: Low**
- Import bugs would not be caught until reported by a user; may require expensive hotfixes/releases after deployment.
- Reduces test confidence if critical resource lifecycle phase is absent from regression/coverage matrix.

## Location

No reference to import steps (with CheckImportState or related), e.g.:

```go
// Missing:
// Step with ImportState: true
// Or TestStep with resource.ImportStateCheckFunc, etc.
```

## Code Issue

No test block covers import:

```go
// Expected example:
Steps: []resource.TestStep{
    {
        ResourceName: "powerplatform_environment.development",
        ImportState: true,
        ImportStateVerify: true,
    },
}
```

## Fix

- Add acceptance test steps in (at minimum) `TestAccEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Create` or a dedicated import test for `powerplatform_environment`, verifying all attributes are correctly imported and no drift detected on a subsequent plan.

```go
tfunc TestAccEnvironmentsResource_Import(t *testing.T) {
    resource.Test(t, resource.TestCase{
        Steps: []resource.TestStep{
            {
                ResourceName: "powerplatform_environment.development",
                ImportState: true,
                ImportStateVerify: true,
            },
        },
    })
}
```

This would increase test coverage and user confidence significantly.
