# No Test Coverage or Validations for GetConnectors

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connectors/api_connectors.go

## Problem

The code for `GetConnectors` does not appear to be covered by any associated tests, and there are no data validation steps on responses before using their fields. The function assumes response arrays and nested properties will always exist as expected.  

## Impact

A lack of tests can allow regressions and faulty behavior to go unnoticed. Furthermore, not validating API responses before use could cause runtime panics if the API schema changes, or if a response is missing expected data. The severity is **medium** for testing and **medium** for robustness.

## Location

Entire `GetConnectors` function.

## Code Issue

_No tests or validation for API response arrays or required fields before iterating or dereferencing._

## Fix

- Add unit tests for this file, mocking API responses (including malformed or incomplete data).
- Check the length/validity of slices/fields before accessing inside loops.

Example validation:

```go
if connectorArray.Value == nil {
	return nil, fmt.Errorf("no connector data returned from API")
}
```
Example test (to be placed in a `_test.go` file):

```go
func TestGetConnectorsReturnsErrorOnEmptyApiResponse(t *testing.T) {
  // Setup: mock API to return empty or invalid data, assert error or empty result returned.
}
```

This issue relates to both testing and type/data validation.
