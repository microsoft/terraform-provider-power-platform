# Title

Superfluous Imports

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/resource_managed_environment_test.go

## Problem

The import for `fmt` appears only to be used as part of constructing mock file names for httpmock registration. For test clarity, consider localizing these uses, or using `fmt.Sprintf` directly in the rare case, or, if not used anywhere else, remove unused imports.

## Impact

Low. Cluttered imports make the code slightly less readable/maintainable, but do not affect test results.

## Location

Imports at the top of the file:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    // ...
)
```

## Code Issue

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    // ...
)
```

## Fix

Remove any unused imports. Only retain if needed for maintenance or code clarity.

```go
// If not used:
import (
    // "fmt", // remove if not used
)
```
