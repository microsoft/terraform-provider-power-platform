# Lack of Unit Test Coverage for API Error Branches

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/api_managed_environment.go

## Problem

This file does not include or indicate the presence of accompanying tests, especially for the various error branches: API request failure, empty/invalid URL handling, recursive retries, and corner cases like invalid environment IDs. 

## Impact

- **Medium severity**
- Increases the risk of undetected regressions or missed edge cases in error handling.
- Makes future refactoring riskier, as changes may silently break error/edge case handling.

## Location

All exported public interface functions and error branches in:

- `EnableManagedEnvironment`
- `DisableManagedEnvironment`
- `FetchSolutionCheckerRules`

## Code Issue

No tests are included to verify these error branches:

```go
if err != nil {
    return err
}
...
if lifecycleResponse != nil && lifecycleResponse.State.Id == "Failed" { ... }
...
if client.environmentClient == (environment.Client{}) { ... }
...
if env.Properties.RuntimeEndpoints.PowerAppsAdvisor == "" { ... }
...
if err != nil { ... }
```

## Fix

Write unit tests covering:

- Success cases for each method
- All error branches: API failure, lifecycle failure with retries exhausted, bad/missing URLs, etc.
- Pointer receiver methods with uninitialized client/environment clients

Suggested Go test file:

```go
// internal/services/managed_environment/api_managed_environment_test.go
func TestEnableManagedEnvironment_ErrorPropagation(t *testing.T) {
    // fake api.Client, simulate error cases, assert proper error returned and no panic/recursion leak
}

// ... additional tests for each failure
```
