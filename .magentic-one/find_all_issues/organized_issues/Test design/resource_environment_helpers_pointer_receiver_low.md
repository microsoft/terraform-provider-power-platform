# Title

Type Safety: Use of Pointers Instead of Value Receivers for Stateless Helpers

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/resource_environment.go

## Problem

Numerous helper functions and conversion utilities, such as `addDataverse`, use a pointer receiver (e.g., `r *Resource`) or explicitly pass a pointer even though they do not mutate resource state or require access to the struct other than dependencies that could be passed explicitly. This increases coupling and makes pure functions harder to test or reuse and introduces accidental mutation risk.

## Impact

- **Severity**: Low
- Reduces testability and clarity.
- Increases accidental mutation risk.
- Hinders static analysis and refactoring.

## Location

```go
func addDataverse(ctx context.Context, plan *SourceModel, r *Resource) (string, error)
```

## Code Issue

```go
// Instead of this:
func addDataverse(ctx context.Context, plan *SourceModel, r *Resource) (string, error)

// Prefer this (pass just what's needed, e.g. the EnvironmentClient):
func addDataverse(ctx context.Context, plan *SourceModel, client *EnvironmentClient) (string, error)
```

## Fix

Pass only needed dependencies, not the whole resource receiver, for stateless, side-effect-free, or helper logic. Use value receivers for helpers when possible.

```go
func addDataverse(ctx context.Context, plan *SourceModel, client *EnvironmentClient) (string, error) {
    // ... use client ...
}
```
