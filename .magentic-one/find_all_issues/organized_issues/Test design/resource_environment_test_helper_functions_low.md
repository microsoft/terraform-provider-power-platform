# Lack of Test Helper Functions/Fixtures for Shared Logic

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/resource_environment_test.go

## Problem

There are many repeated blocks across the file, such as mock HTTP responder registrations, standard resource config snippets, and routine test check function combinations. These patterns are routinely copy-pasted rather than centralized in helper functions or shared fixtures.

This file should leverage Go helper functions for common setup, registering HTTP responders, standard config/text templates, and resource check functions. This would prevent duplication, ease refactoring, and reduce cognitive load when reading or editing.

## Impact

- **Severity: Low**
- Increases maintenance burden: repeated blocks have to be changed everywhere if the underlying API/logic changes.
- Makes the code less DRY, reduces ability to spot logical/test setup errors, impedes safe refactoring.
- New contributors may overlook shared patterns, duplicating mistakes or creating drift.

## Location

Multiple locations throughout the file. For instance:

```go
httpmock.RegisterResponder(...)
resource.TestCheckResourceAttr(...)
// [multiple repeated configurations and setup code]
```

## Code Issue

Analogous repeated code in multiple test functions:

```go
httpmock.RegisterResponder("GET", "https://...",
    func(req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
        ...
    })
// ...repeated with different endpoints, cut/paste
...
resource.TestCheckResourceAttr(...)
// composed manually across different steps
```

## Fix

Create and use local helper functions:

```go
func registerStandardMocks() {
    httpmock.RegisterResponder(...)
    ...
}

func envTestConfig(name, loc string) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf(...)
}

func checkDataverseField(field, expected string) resource.TestCheckFunc {
    return resource.TestCheckResourceAttr("powerplatform_environment.development", "dataverse."+field, expected)
}
```

This approach fosters DRY-ness, reduces error, and ensures future maintenance is easier.
