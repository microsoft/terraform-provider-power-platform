# Lack of Test Cleanup for httpmock and Side Effects

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/resource_environment_test.go

## Problem

While many functions in the file activate `httpmock` and use `defer httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()`, the file contains some acceptance tests and stateful test helpers that do not clean up httpmock state (for example, functions with only `resource.Test(...)` and not using httpmock at all, or cases where multiple tests may interfere if run in parallel due to global/mock registration). This can cause flaky tests or unpredictable behavior if tests are ever parallelized, or if added tests depend on external state.

Some tests only initialize httpmock responders and do not reset or deactivate them properly, increasing the risk of cross-test contamination.

## Impact

- **Severity: Medium**
- If tests are ever run in parallel or the file changes to enable concurrency, global mocks might leak or interfere across tests.
- Can cause nondeterministic test results, increased maintenance burden if tests are extended in the future.
- Test interdependence hinders reordering or future refactoring.

## Location

Example (good):
```go
httpmock.Activate()
defer httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
```

Example (potential issue, acceptance, or no reset):
```go
func TestAccEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Update_Name_Field(t *testing.T) {
    resource.Test(t, resource.TestCase{...})
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
func TestAccEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Create(t *testing.T) {
    // No httpmock de/activation for tests that do use/affect HTTP state
    resource.Test(t, resource.TestCase{...})
}
```

## Fix

- Always activate and deactivate httpmock in every test case that requires HTTP mocking.
- If a test does not require HTTP mocking, ensure the test runner isolates HTTP state elsewhere.
- For acceptance tests and those not using mocks, document the distinction or prepare separate test files/runners for clear separation.

```go
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
    httpmock.Activate()
    defer httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
    ...
}
```

Or, for pure acceptance tests,

```go
// Document: This test does not use httpmock!
func TestAccEnvironmentsResource_XYZ(t *testing.T) {
    resource.Test(t, ...)
}
```

Future-proof by ensuring any new test with HTTP side effects is isolated and properly reset, preventing interference.
