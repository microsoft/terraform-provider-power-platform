# Unscoped Package Imports in Test Package

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_settings/resource_environment_settings_test.go

## Problem

The test file uses the package declaration `package environment_settings_test` but imports internal code such as `mocks` from `terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/mocks`. Using the `_test` suffix for the test package supports black-box testing, but importing internals directly here partially nullifies that. If test code depends on unexported members, these patterns reduce the effectivity and clarity of testing boundaries.

## Impact

This affects maintainability (severity: low). Black-box versus white-box testing boundaries are muddied; if internal types and helpers are needed, either the test should be in the package under test (`package environment_settings`), or the code structure should expose only whatâ€™s minimally necessary.

## Location

```go
package environment_settings_test

import (
	// ...
	"github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/mocks"
)
```

## Code Issue

```go
package environment_settings_test

import (
	// ...
	"github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/mocks"
)
```

## Fix

Either:

- Move tests to the package under test if you need access to unexported members (`package environment_settings`)
- Or adjust internals and test helpers to better suit intended testing boundaries.  
- As an immediate fix, consider:

```go
package environment_settings

// or, if you want to maintain black-box but need exports, refactor the API exposure and test stubs.
```
