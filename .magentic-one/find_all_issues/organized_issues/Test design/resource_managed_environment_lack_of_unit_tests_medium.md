# Title

Lack of directly associated unit tests for resource logic

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/resource_managed_environment.go

## Problem

There are no in-file or nearby inline unit tests covering the direct logic of `ManagedEnvironmentResource` methods (Create, Read, Update, Delete, ImportState), such as solution checker rule validation, DTO mapping, or error handling pathways. 

Without close unit tests, regression risk increases, and bugs in logic (validation, error propagation, state setting) may go undetected until integration test or user deployment.

## Impact

Medium. Reduces confidence in reliability, increases future bug risk, and slows down refactoring. Direct resource/unit-level tests are essential for reliability in infrastructure providers.

## Location

Entire fileâ€”all primary handlers.

## Code Issue

No test functions for main method flows, edge cases or error scenarios.

## Fix

Develop a matching set of Go unit tests for this resource handler file, covering success/error paths for:
- Validation of rule overrides
- Type assertion and client initializations
- API error propagation
- Edge cases (missing fields, nil checks)
- Full lifecycle: create/update/read/delete

This helps to lock in expected behavior and to detect regressions early.
