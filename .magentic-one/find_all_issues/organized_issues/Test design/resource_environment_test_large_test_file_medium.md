# Excessively Large Test File Without Separation

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/resource_environment_test.go

## Problem

The test file contains a very large number of test cases (~5000+ lines), encompassing both unit and acceptance tests, intricate http mocking setups, state value checks, and advanced environment scenarios all bundled into a single file. This bulk reduces navigability, makes code review difficult, lengthens build/test times, and increases the chance of merge conflicts for teams.

Best practice recommends separating unit and acceptance/system/integration tests into separate files by concern or feature, and grouping large scenario families into dedicated test files or folders. Helper functions, repeated config, and shared mocks should reside in separate files or packages.

## Impact

- **Severity: Medium**
- Slower test runs and longer feedback loops (test binaries are bigger, harder to focus on failed test context).
- Difficult for new team members to onboard or extend specific test cases without fear of unintended side effects.
- Risk of merge conflicts and lost work grows linearly with file size.
- Encourages anti-patterns like one giant test suite instead of modular, well-scoped behavioral testing.

## Location

Entire file (one massive file, mixes unit, acceptance, mock, and state test logic).

## Code Issue

```go
// Several thousand lines of tests in one file, e.g.
func TestUnitEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Attribute_Validators ...
func TestAccEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Update_Name_Field ...
// ... 50+ similar functions
```

## Fix

Refactor the tests into multiple files:
- `resource_environment_unit_test.go` for unit/mocked logic
- `resource_environment_acc_test.go` for acceptance/system/integration cases
- `resource_environment_helpers.go` for shared helpers/mocks/configs

Consider further sub-division by feature (e.g., group by CRUD or validation scenario) as the codebase grows.

```
/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/
    resource_environment_unit_test.go
    resource_environment_acc_test.go
    resource_environment_helpers.go
```

This will improve maintainability, code review, and test reliability significantly.
