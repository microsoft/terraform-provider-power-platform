# Duplicate or Colliding Test Function Names in Unit/Acceptance Tests

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/resource_environment_test.go

## Problem

There are near-duplicate test function names for acceptance and unit tests (e.g., `TestUnitEnvironmentsResource_Validate_{Scenario}` and `TestAccEnvironmentsResource_Validate_{Scenario}`). This can lead to confusion about test intent, makes it difficult for contributors to know which tests are meant for what type of environment/scenario, and increases the risk that future test additions collide or overwrite one another by accident.

In some IDEs or test runners, test functions with only a suffix difference (`Acc` vs `Unit`) will be harder to discover distinctly.

## Impact

- **Severity: Low**
- Makes it more error-prone for developers to choose or run the right test.
- Could cause accidental editing or conflicts if someone edits the wrong function for a given scenario.
- Increases cognitive load for maintainers and increases review time.

## Location

Example patterns (repeated for multiple scenarios):

```go
func TestUnitEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Attribute_Validators(t *testing.T) {...}
func TestAccEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Attribute_Validators(t *testing.T) {...}
```

## Code Issue

Repeated everywhere both unit and acceptance test exist for the same resource scenario.

## Fix

- Add documentation at the top of the file explaining the naming convention.
- (Better) Separate unit and acceptance tests into different files (as previously suggested), which will prevent name/collision confusion.
- Make naming more explicit, e.g. `TestEnvironmentsResource_Unit_Validate_...` and `TestEnvironmentsResource_Acceptance_Validate_...`, or introduce consistent package-level suffixing or tagging for test kinds.
