# No Reference to Unit or Integration Testing

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/admin_management_application/resource_admin_management_application.go

## Problem

The file contains no evidence of in-code testability hooks like interface abstraction or pluggable dependencies for the `AdminManagementApplicationClient`. There are also no references to testsâ€”either as comments, examples, or test scaffolds. This makes it difficult to write unit or integration tests for this resource and may hinder future maintenance or refactoring.

## Impact

Severity: **medium**

Lack of testability is a medium severity concern. If future changes are made, it will become hard to validate correctness or catch regressions without proper test surfaces.

## Location

- Applies to the entire resource file implementation.

## Code Issue

Example (current state):

```go
r.AdminManagementApplicationClient = newAdminManagementApplicationClient(client.Api)
```

There is no way to provide a mock or fake implementation in unit tests.

## Fix

Refactor to inject the client via an interface which can be replaced in test builds:

```go
type ManagementAppClient interface {
    GetAdminApplication(ctx context.Context, id string) (...)
    RegisterAdminApplication(ctx context.Context, id string) (...)
    UnregisterAdminApplication(ctx context.Context, id string) error
}

// In struct
type AdminManagementApplicationResource struct {
    ...
    Client ManagementAppClient
}

// Then inject a mock/fake or the real implementation in production code.
```

Document or scaffold an example test file for the core resource behaviors.
