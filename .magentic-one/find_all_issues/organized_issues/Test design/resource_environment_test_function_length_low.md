# Test Functions Exceed Recommended Length (Readability Issue)

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/resource_environment_test.go

## Problem

Several test functions, especially those that create dozens of httpmock responders and define extensive config, extend well beyond a "screenful" of logic (~50+ lines), making it difficult to visually parse and increasing review burden. For professional Go codebases, best practice recommends splitting lengthy tests into setup, config, action, and assert phases (using helpers if needed).

## Impact

- **Severity: Low**
- Makes navigating tests harder for new reviewers.
- Increased chance of missed errors or `copy-paste`-driven bugs due to large code blocks.
- Discourages focused, single-responsibility testing; instead, monolithic functions become common.

## Location

Throughout the file; for example:

```go
func TestUnitEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Create_And_Force_Recreate(t *testing.T) {
    httpmock.Activate()
    defer httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
    mocks.ActivateEnvironmentHttpMocks()
    // dozens of responders and steps, config, etc.
    resource.Test(t, resource.TestCase{...})
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
// 100+ line test functions mixing setup, config, multiple scenarios
func TestUnitEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Create_And_Force_Recreate(t *testing.T) {
    // ...
}
```

## Fix

Split large test functions into smaller logical pieces by creating helpers for repetitive responder registration, config template instantiation, and repeated checks/assertions.

For example:

```go
func setupCreateAndForceRecreateResponders() {
    // register all responders
}

func TestUnitEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Create_And_Force_Recreate(t *testing.T) {
    httpmock.Activate()
    defer httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
    setupCreateAndForceRecreateResponders()
    resource.Test(t, ...)
}
```

Or, if complex checks/config are needed, extract to table-driven test or sub-functions for clarity.
