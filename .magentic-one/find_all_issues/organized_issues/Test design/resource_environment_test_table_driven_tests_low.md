# Missed Opportunity: No Use of Table-Driven Tests for Similar Scenarios

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/resource_environment_test.go

## Problem

Many test cases repeat similar scenario patterns: variable construction/config, `resource.TestCase` setup, field value permutations, etc., but these are expanded into separate functions or large blocks, rather than unified using Go's idiomatic table-driven test format. This increases duplication and makes broadening coverage harder.

Table-driven tests are a Go best practice and provide clarity, reduce repetition, and simplify test extension and maintenance for similar validation, error, or config scenarios.

## Impact

- **Severity: Low**
- More repetitive test code: harder to add new cases, reason about coverage, or refactor shared logic across changed APIs/options.
- Increases risk of missed scenarios and undetected test gaps for config variations.

## Location

Multiple places, for example (pseudocode):

```go
for _, scenario := range []struct {
    name string
    config string
    expect string
}{...} {
    // Not used, but would be ideal for the config permutations/tests in this file.
}
```

## Code Issue

Repeated function blocks for similar checks instead of a compact, table-driven form.

## Fix

Refactor to use table-driven tests for related scenarios, like config or field permutations, environment type variations, or expected error outcomes:

```go
func TestEnvironmentFieldPermutations(t *testing.T) {
    cases := []struct{
        name string
        config string
        want string
    }{
        {"with dataverse", config1, want1},
        {"without dataverse", config2, want2},
        ...
    }
    for _, c := range cases {
        t.Run(c.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            ...
        })
    }
}
```

This aids DRYness, coverage, and future refactoring efforts.
