# Overly Duplicated Test Data Strings

##

`/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/dlp_policy/resource_dlp_policy_test.go`

## Problem

The test file contains many large string constants comprising JSON payloads (policyResponse1â€“policyResponse6), with significant duplication between them. This bloat makes maintenance difficult and increases the likelihood of inconsistencies or errors when updating test data for new API features or fixes.

## Impact

**Severity: Low**  
While not affecting functionality, this code duplication makes the file difficult to maintain, increases merge conflict risk, and obscures test differences.

## Location

Example of duplicated responses:

```go
policyResponse1 := fmt.Sprintf(`{
    "policyDefinition": {
        "name": "%s",
        "displayName": "Block All Policy",
        ...
    },
    "customConnectorUrlPatternsDefinition": {
        "rules": [ ... ]
    }
}`, policyId)

policyResponse2 := fmt.Sprintf(`{
    "policyDefinition": {
        "name": "%s",
        "displayName": "Block All Policy_1",
        ...
    },
    "customConnectorUrlPatternsDefinition": {
        "rules": [ ... ]
    }
}`, policyId)

// ...Up to policyResponse6, mostly duplicating structure.
```

## Fix

Extract common portions to helper functions or use a `makePolicyResponse` function that takes only the necessary fields as arguments (e.g., name, displayName, groups, etc.), and generates the JSON payload as needed.

```go
func makePolicyResponse(name, displayName string, ...otherArgs) string {
    // Use fmt.Sprintf or a struct+json.Marshal to build JSON
}

// Use: 
policyResponse1 := makePolicyResponse(policyId, "Block All Policy", ...)
policyResponse2 := makePolicyResponse(policyId, "Block All Policy_1", ...)
```

Or, use Go's template engine or even defined Go structs marshaled to JSON for more robust and type-safe test data.
