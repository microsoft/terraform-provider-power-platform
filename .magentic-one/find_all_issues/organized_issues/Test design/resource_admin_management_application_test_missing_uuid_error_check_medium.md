# Missing Error Check for uuid.NewRandom

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/admin_management_application/resource_admin_management_application_test.go

## Problem

In the `TestUnitAdminManagementApplicationResource_Validate_Create` function, the creation of a new UUID using `uuid.NewRandom()` is performed as:

```go
client_id, _ := uuid.NewRandom()
```

Here, the error returned by `uuid.NewRandom()` is ignored, which is not a recommended Go practice even in tests. Any potential error occurring here will not be caught, which could cause subtle test bugs or failed runs.

## Impact

- **Severity: Medium**
- If uuid.NewRandom() fails (should be rare but possible in extreme conditions such as lack of system entropy), the client_id will be nil, possibly leading to unexpected panics or incorrect test behavior.
- This can complicate debugging and reduce confidence in the test suiteâ€™s accuracy.

## Location

Line:

```go
client_id, _ := uuid.NewRandom()
```

## Code Issue

```go
client_id, _ := uuid.NewRandom()
```

## Fix

Check and handle the error, failing the test if generating the UUID fails:

```go
client_id, err := uuid.NewRandom()
if err != nil {
	t.Fatalf("failed to generate uuid: %v", err)
}
```
