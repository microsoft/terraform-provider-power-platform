# Lack of Field Documentation

##

internal/services/copilot_studio_application_insights/dto.go

## Problem

The struct fields across all types lack documentation comments, which diminishes the codebase's maintainability and clarity for other developers. Public fields, especially in exported types, should include comments describing their purpose, especially when types are unclear or project-specific.

## Impact

Absence of comments may lead to misunderstandings about the intent or usage of each field and increase onboarding time for new contributors. This is a **low** severity issue.

## Location

Throughout the entire file (struct field declarations).

## Code Issue

```go
type CopilotStudioAppInsightsDto struct {
	EnvironmentId               string `json:"environmentId"`
	BotId                       string `json:"botId"`
	AppInsightsConnectionString string `json:"appInsightsConnectionString"`
	IncludeSensitiveInformation bool   `json:"includeSensitiveInformation"`
	IncludeActivities           bool   `json:"includeActivities"`
	IncludeActions              bool   `json:"includeActions"`
	Errors                      string `json:"errors"`
	NetworkIsolation            string `json:"networkIsolation"`
}
```

## Fix

Add documentation comments for each struct and exported field:

```go
// CopilotStudioAppInsightsDto represents the app insights configuration for a Copilot Studio environment.
type CopilotStudioAppInsightsDto struct {
	// EnvironmentId is the identifier for the environment.
	EnvironmentId string `json:"environmentId"`

	// BotId is the unique identifier for the bot.
	BotId string `json:"botId"`

	// AppInsightsConnectionString is the connection string for Application Insights.
	AppInsightsConnectionString string `json:"appInsightsConnectionString"`

	// IncludeSensitiveInformation indicates if sensitive information should be included.
	IncludeSensitiveInformation bool `json:"includeSensitiveInformation"`

	// IncludeActivities specifies if bot activities should be included.
	IncludeActivities bool `json:"includeActivities"`

	// IncludeActions determines if actions are included.
	IncludeActions bool `json:"includeActions"`

	// Errors describes error messages captured during operations.
	Errors string `json:"errors"`

	// NetworkIsolation describes any applied network isolation settings.
	NetworkIsolation string `json:"networkIsolation"`
}
```
