# Use of Package Import Alias for Terraform Plugin Framework Timeouts

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_templates/models.go

## Problem

The package `"github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-timeouts/resource/timeouts"` is imported with its full path and used as `timeouts.Value`. However, the conventional import for Terraform Plugin Framework Timeouts would use aliasing for clarity and readability, since `timeouts.Value` might be confused with a generic timeout utility across a large codebase.

## Impact

Low severity, but may impact readability and long-term maintainability, especially for new contributors.

## Location

```go
import (
    ...
    "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-timeouts/resource/timeouts"
    ...
)
...
Timeouts  timeouts.Value                  `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
```

## Code Issue

```go
    "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-timeouts/resource/timeouts"
...
Timeouts  timeouts.Value                  `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
```

## Fix

Consider using an import alias for clarity:

```go
import (
    ...
    tftimeouts "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-timeouts/resource/timeouts"
    ...
)

Timeouts  tftimeouts.Value                  `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
```
