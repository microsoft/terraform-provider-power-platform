# Issue: Ignoring error returned by `State.Get`

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connection/datasource_connections.go

## Problem

In the `Read` method, the code calls `resp.State.Get(ctx, &state)` and does not check or handle the returned diagnostics. If the retrieval of the state fails, this could lead to unexpected behavior or panics due to operating on an uninitialized or partially initialized state.

## Impact

Severity: **High**

Ignoring errors from state loading may cause unexpected behaviors, such as attempting to dereference incomplete or invalid state fields. This may cause bugs that are difficult to diagnose, as the source of the state error is ignored and logic proceeds regardless.

## Location

```go
func (d *ConnectionsDataSource) Read(ctx context.Context, req datasource.ReadRequest, resp *datasource.ReadResponse) {
    ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, d.TypeInfo, req)
    defer exitContext()

    var state ConnectionsListDataSourceModel
    resp.State.Get(ctx, &state)
    ...
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
var state ConnectionsListDataSourceModel
resp.State.Get(ctx, &state)
```

## Fix

Handle and check the diagnostics returned by `State.Get()`, and append them to the response before returning if errors are found.

```go
var state ConnectionsListDataSourceModel
diags := resp.State.Get(ctx, &state)
resp.Diagnostics.Append(diags...)
if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
    return
}
```
