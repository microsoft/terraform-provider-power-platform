# Title

Unnecessary or Inconsistent Use of `any` Type Over Specific Types for Solution Components

##

internal/services/solution/api_solution.go

## Problem

In the helper function `createSolutionComponentParameters`, the code creates and returns a slice of `any` rather than a more specific type, even though all elements are known to be either `importSolutionConnectionReferencesDto` or `importSolutionEnvironmentVariablesDto`.

## Impact

Severity: **low**. This reduces type safety and makes the code less self-documenting. While Go allows this, it's best practice to restrict slices to more specific types (or even to an interface if polymorphism is needed), which aids code clarity, consistency, and better compile-time checking.

## Location

```go
func (client *Client) createSolutionComponentParameters(settings []byte) ([]any, error) {
    // ...
    solutionComponents := make([]any, 0)
    for _, connectionReferenceComponent := range solutionSettings.ConnectionReferences {
        solutionComponents = append(solutionComponents, importSolutionConnectionReferencesDto{...})
    }
    for _, envVariableComponent := range solutionSettings.EnvironmentVariables {
        if envVariableComponent.Value != "" {
            solutionComponents = append(solutionComponents, importSolutionEnvironmentVariablesDto{...})
        }
    }
    if len(solutionComponents) == 0 {
        return nil, nil
    }
    return solutionComponents, nil
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
func (client *Client) createSolutionComponentParameters(settings []byte) ([]any, error) { ... }
solutionComponents := make([]any, 0)
```

## Fix

If only these two types are ever allowed as solution components (and they don't share a useful interface), consider creating a dedicated interface or making the slice type more well-defined, or document this with a comment. If polymorphism is unnecessary, use `[]importSolutionComponent`, where `importSolutionComponent` is an interface satisfied by both types.

Example:

```go
type importSolutionComponent interface{}

func (client *Client) createSolutionComponentParameters(settings []byte) ([]importSolutionComponent, error) {
    solutionComponents := make([]importSolutionComponent, 0)
    // ... as before
    return solutionComponents, nil
}
```
Or, if only struct values are appended and you donâ€™t need the flexibility, simply use two separate lists or one encompassing struct.
