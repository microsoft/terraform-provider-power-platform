# Title

Inefficient environment update in Create and Update functions

##

internal/services/licensing/resource_billing_policy_environment.go

## Problem

In both `Create` and `Update` methods, the code fetches the list of current environments, removes all environments from the billing policy, and then re-adds the intended environments. This "remove all, then add all" pattern will result in unnecessary API calls if the set of environments hasn't changed or only a few have changed. This is inefficient and can cause excessive network usage or rate limiting, and may introduce a window where the policy has no environments at all.

Additionally, `plan.Environments` is assigned as the result of `GetEnvironmentsForBillingPolicy` after modification, which could further confuse the intended plan versus the actual resulting state.

## Impact

Severity: medium

This can cause unnecessary API traffic, longer provisioning time, potential for partial updates or race conditions (especially in concurrent systems), and can make the infrastructure momentarily inconsistent.

## Location

`Create` and `Update` methods, for example:

```go
environments, err := r.LicensingClient.GetEnvironmentsForBillingPolicy(ctx, plan.BillingPolicyId)
if err != nil { ... }

err = r.LicensingClient.RemoveEnvironmentsToBillingPolicy(ctx, plan.BillingPolicyId, environments)
if err != nil { ... }

err = r.LicensingClient.AddEnvironmentsToBillingPolicy(ctx, plan.BillingPolicyId, plan.Environments)
if err != nil { ... }
```

## Code Issue

```go
environments, err := r.LicensingClient.GetEnvironmentsForBillingPolicy(ctx, plan.BillingPolicyId)
if err != nil { ... }

err = r.LicensingClient.RemoveEnvironmentsToBillingPolicy(ctx, plan.BillingPolicyId, environments)
if err != nil { ... }

err = r.LicensingClient.AddEnvironmentsToBillingPolicy(ctx, plan.BillingPolicyId, plan.Environments)
if err != nil { ... }
```

## Fix

Before removing and adding, compare the current and planned environments to only remove environments that are not in the plan and only add new environments not currently associated.

```go
currentEnvironments, err := r.LicensingClient.GetEnvironmentsForBillingPolicy(ctx, plan.BillingPolicyId)
if err != nil { ... }

// Determine environments to remove and add (pseudo-code)
toRemove := difference(currentEnvironments, plan.Environments)
toAdd := difference(plan.Environments, currentEnvironments)

if len(toRemove) > 0 {
    err = r.LicensingClient.RemoveEnvironmentsToBillingPolicy(ctx, plan.BillingPolicyId, toRemove)
    if err != nil { ... }
}
if len(toAdd) > 0 {
    err = r.LicensingClient.AddEnvironmentsToBillingPolicy(ctx, plan.BillingPolicyId, toAdd)
    if err != nil { ... }
}
```

Implement utility functions (such as `difference`) to compare string slices/sets efficiently. This will minimize calls and race conditions.
