# Title

No Context Passed to Downstream HTTP/API Calls

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution_checker_rules/client.go

## Problem

Usage of `c.Api.Execute` in `GetSolutionCheckerRules` passes the `ctx` (good), but the client invocation to `environmentClient.GetEnvironment` also uses `ctx` (good). However, it's important to review whether the underlying API client and environment client methods actually honor the provided context. If these methods do not propagate or respect context cancellation/deadlines, then breaking user expectations around request cancellation and timeouts.

_Note: If the called methods do propagate it, that's expected. If not, API call context may not be honored._

## Impact

If context is not honored by the underlying client layers, requests could linger beyond user-requested cancellation. This can lead to resource leaks and unresponsive cancellation. Severity: medium.

## Location

Within `GetSolutionCheckerRules`:

```go
env, err := c.environmentClient.GetEnvironment(ctx, environmentId)
// ... 
_, err = c.Api.Execute(ctx, nil, "GET", rulesUrl.String(), nil, nil, []int{http.StatusOK}, &rules)
```

## Code Issue

```go
env, err := c.environmentClient.GetEnvironment(ctx, environmentId)
//...
_, err = c.Api.Execute(ctx, nil, "GET", rulesUrl.String(), nil, nil, []int{http.StatusOK}, &rules)
```

## Fix

Review `environmentClient.GetEnvironment` and `c.Api.Execute` implementations to ensure they accept and properly handle context. If they do not, alter their signatures/implementations to propagate `ctx` down to the actual HTTP transport layers.

Example fix at call site or in client code (if missing):

```go
func (c *Client) Execute(ctx context.Context, ...) {
	req, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, ...)
	// ...
}
```
