# Title

DTO Types Are Not Defined in File, Reducing Code Readability

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connection/api_connection.go

## Problem

Types such as `createDto`, `connectionDto`, `connectionArrayDto`, `shareConnectionRequestDto`, etc., are referenced without being defined or imported in this file or shown in nearby documentation, making it difficult for a reader to fully understand the request and response contracts.

## Impact

Reduces code readability and discoverability for developers unfamiliar with the codebase, and complicates onboarding and audit. Severity: Low.

## Location

Through the file, examples:

```go
func (client *client) CreateConnection(ctx context.Context, environmentId, connectorName string, connectionToCreate createDto) (*connectionDto, error)
```

## Code Issue

```go
func (client *client) CreateConnection(ctx context.Context, environmentId, connectorName string, connectionToCreate createDto) (*connectionDto, error)
```

## Fix

Add file-level comments documenting the main request and response DTOs used, or include import/documentation pointers to where they're defined.

```go
// createDto: see dto.go
// connectionDto: see dto.go
```
Or alternatively, add import path or types near top of file for clarity.
