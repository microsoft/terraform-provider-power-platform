# Inconsistent Path Case for "BillingPolicies" between API Methods

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/api_licensing.go

## Problem

The API path for "BillingPolicies" uses different case conventions in different functions â€” sometimes "BillingPolicies" and other times "billingPolicies". This could cause issues if the upstream service is case-sensitive or for future maintainers expecting consistency.

## Impact

Medium. Could lead to difficult-to-trace bugs if the backend is case-sensitive, and it is confusing for maintainers.

## Location

Lines such as:

```go
Path: "licensing/billingPolicies",
Path: "/licensing/BillingPolicies",
Path: fmt.Sprintf("/licensing/billingPolicies/%s", billingId),
Path: fmt.Sprintf("/licensing/BillingPolicies/%s", billingId),
```

## Code Issue

```go
Path:   "licensing/billingPolicies",
...
Path:   "/licensing/BillingPolicies",
```

## Fix

Standardize on a single casing for "billingPolicies" (preferably lowercase, if that's how the API expects it), e.g.:

```go
Path:   "licensing/billingPolicies",
...
Path:   fmt.Sprintf("/licensing/billingPolicies/%s", billingId),
...
Path:   "/licensing/billingPolicies",
```
