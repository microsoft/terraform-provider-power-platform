# Title

Unexported Struct and Constructor Should Be Exported

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution_checker_rules/client.go

## Problem

The `client` struct and `newSolutionCheckerRulesClient` function are unexported (lowercase names), despite forming the main implementation for client API interactions. In Go convention, if these types and constructors are intended to be used outside `solution_checker_rules` package, they should be exported. If not, usage is fine. However, most provider submodules typically export their client.

## Impact

If this struct or constructor needs to be accessed from other packages (internals or tests), current unexported names prevent such use, thus limiting testability and extendibility. This is a medium severity maintainability and package structure issue.

## Location

- Definition of `client` struct and `newSolutionCheckerRulesClient` constructor.

## Code Issue

```go
type client struct {
	Api               *api.Client
	environmentClient environment.Client
}

func newSolutionCheckerRulesClient(apiClient *api.Client) client {
	return client{
		Api:               apiClient,
		environmentClient: environment.NewEnvironmentClient(apiClient),
	}
}
```

## Fix

Export struct and constructor by uppercasing their names, if outside access is required. Also return a pointer as Go convention for client types.

```go
type Client struct {
	Api               *api.Client
	environmentClient environment.Client
}

func NewSolutionCheckerRulesClient(apiClient *api.Client) *Client {
	return &Client{
		Api:               apiClient,
		environmentClient: environment.NewEnvironmentClient(apiClient),
	}
}
```
