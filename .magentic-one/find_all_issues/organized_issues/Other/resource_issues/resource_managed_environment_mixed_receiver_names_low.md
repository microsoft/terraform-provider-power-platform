# Title

Mixed receiver variable names for resource struct

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/resource_managed_environment.go

## Problem

The methods of `ManagedEnvironmentResource` consistently use `r` as the receiver variable, which is in line with Go idioms for short receiver names. However, review for future consistency is warranted if any methods (especially in generated or expanded files) use a different name, as inconsistent receiver names reduce readability and can introduce confusion when navigating method sets in large files.

## Impact

Low. Currently not a direct inconsistency, but ensuring standardization guards against maintenance issues as the codebase grows or is refactored.

## Location

All method receivers for `ManagedEnvironmentResource`, i.e.

## Code Issue

```go
func (r *ManagedEnvironmentResource) ...
```

## Fix

Maintain use of `r` for the receiver variable throughout all present and future methods of this type, and review for stray or mismatched receiver variables as the codebase evolves.
