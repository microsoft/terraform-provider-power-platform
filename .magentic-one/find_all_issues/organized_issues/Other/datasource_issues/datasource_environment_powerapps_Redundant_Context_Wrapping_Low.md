# Minor Code Structure: Redundant Context Wrapping

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/powerapps/datasource_environment_powerapps.go

## Problem

Every method starts with wrapping the context (`ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, d.TypeInfo, req)`), and uses `defer exitContext()`. If this wrapping doesn't always adjust the context or if it adds a no-op in some cases, doing it everywhere is unnecessary and may confuse future maintainers.

## Impact

Severity: Low  
Although it doesn't introduce functional error, it makes the code slightly harder to audit and could decrease readability.

## Location

```go
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, d.TypeInfo, req)
defer exitContext()
```

## Code Issue

```go
ctx, exitContext := helpers.EnterRequestContext(ctx, d.TypeInfo, req)
defer exitContext()
```

## Fix

If `EnterRequestContext` is always required then this is not an issue. If not, refactor to only call it where necessary and document the reason for context wrapping per-method.
