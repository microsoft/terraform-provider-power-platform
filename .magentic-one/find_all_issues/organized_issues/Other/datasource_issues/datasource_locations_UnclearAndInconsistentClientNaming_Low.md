# Unclear and Inconsistent Naming for `LocationsClient` and Function `newLocationsClient`

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/locations/datasource_locations.go

## Problem

The data source defines the field:
```go
LocationsClient client
```
But the type `client` is not imported directly, nor is it clear from context what this type is. Additionally, the function
```go
d.LocationsClient = newLocationsClient(client.Api)
```
suggests the function `newLocationsClient` returns a type compatible with the `LocationsClient` field, but the return and expected types are not explicit nor named with clarity.

This makes the intent and usage unclear:
- Is `client` a concrete type, an interface?  
- The function name, type, and field all use `client`, but with ambiguous casing and without a clear definition in this file.

## Impact

This reduces maintainability, readability, and type safety. Misaligned or unclear names hinder comprehension and can create integration bugs, especially if the underlying `client` or its constructor change elsewhere. **Severity: Low**

## Location

- Field declaration in `DataSource` struct
- Usage in `Configure` method

## Code Issue

```go
type DataSource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	LocationsClient client
}
```
and
```go
d.LocationsClient = newLocationsClient(client.Api)
```

## Fix

- Import and reference the actual type clearly (e.g., `api.LocationsClient` if that is the intent).
- Consider using more explicit naming, e.g.:
  - `LocationsClient api.LocationsClient`
  - Instantiated as `api.NewLocationsClient(client.Api)`
- If it is an interface, state so in the naming and usage.

```go
type DataSource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	LocationsClient api.LocationsClient
}

// ...

d.LocationsClient = api.NewLocationsClient(client.Api)
```
And ensure imports are explicit.
