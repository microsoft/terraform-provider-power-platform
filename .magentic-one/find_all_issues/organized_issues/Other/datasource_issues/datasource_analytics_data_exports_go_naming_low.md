# Variable Naming - Receiver Variable `d` is Non-Descriptive

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/analytics_data_export/datasource_analytics_data_exports.go

## Problem

The receiver variable for `AnalyticsExportDataSource` methods is named `d` throughout the file:

```go
func (d *AnalyticsExportDataSource) ...
```

Single-letter receiver variable names harm readability and maintainability, especially in types that are complex or domain-specific. More descriptive names are encouraged by Go best practices unless the type is very obviously generic or widely used.

## Impact

Minor readability and maintainability issue, as this is a prevalent but not critical concern.

**Severity:** Low.

## Location

Throughout method declarations, for example:

```go
func (d *AnalyticsExportDataSource) Metadata(...)
func (d *AnalyticsExportDataSource) Schema(...)
func (d *AnalyticsExportDataSource) Configure(...)
func (d *AnalyticsExportDataSource) Read(...)
```

## Code Issue

```go
func (d *AnalyticsExportDataSource) Schema(...)
```

## Fix

Use a more descriptive receiver name, e.g., `ds` or `dataSource` for clarity:

```go
func (ds *AnalyticsExportDataSource) Schema(...)
```
