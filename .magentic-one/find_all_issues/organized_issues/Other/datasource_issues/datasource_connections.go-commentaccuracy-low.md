# Issue: Misleading comments in codebase

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connection/datasource_connections.go

## Problem

The file contains comments that mention "resource" while this file actually implements a data source (e.g., "...Set the type name for the resource..."). While comments are not functionally parsed by Go, inaccurate comments can confuse contributors.

## Impact

Severity: **Low**

This can mislead users and maintainers, especially those less familiar with the framework. It does not affect runtime code, but it does affect maintainability and knowledge transfer.

## Location

```go
// Set the type name for the resource to providername_resourcename.
```

## Code Issue

```go
// Set the type name for the resource to providername_resourcename.
resp.TypeName = d.FullTypeName()
```

## Fix

Update the comment to accurately reflect the data source context:

```go
// Set the type name for the data source to providername_resourcename.
resp.TypeName = d.FullTypeName()
```
