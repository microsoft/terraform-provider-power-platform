# Lack of Comments for Complex Mocks or Custom Logic

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/datasource_environment_application_packages_test.go

## Problem

Although comments are present at the top, the body of the file, particularly HTTP mock responder lambdas, lacks comments explaining custom logic (such as dynamic file path selection). Comments can help future maintainers and reviewers understand the intent.

## Impact

Severity: Low

While this does not affect correctness, it impedes maintainability, especially if more logic is introduced or if the matching or mocking patterns are not trivial.

## Location

For example:

```go
id := httpmock.MustGetSubmatch(req, 1)
return httpmock.NewStringResponse(http.StatusOK, httpmock.File(fmt.Sprintf("tests/datasource/environment_application_packages/Validate_Read/get_environment_%s.json", id)).String()), nil
```

## Fix

Add comments before custom/mock logic inside lambdas:

```go
// Provide environment-specific response based on captured environment ID.
id := httpmock.MustGetSubmatch(req, 1)
```
