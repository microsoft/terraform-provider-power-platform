# Inefficient Slice Growth in BillingPolicies Population

##
/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/datasource_billing_policies.go

## Problem

When appending to `state.BillingPolicies`, the slice is not preallocated. For potentially large numbers of policies, appending in a loop can cause multiple unnecessary allocations.

## Impact

This issue has "low" severity and impacts performance for large tenants by causing repeated slice resizings, which are suboptimal.

## Location

In the `Read` method:
```go
for _, policy := range policies {
    state.BillingPolicies = append(state.BillingPolicies, BillingPolicyDataSourceModel{
        //...
    })
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
for _, policy := range policies {
    state.BillingPolicies = append(state.BillingPolicies, BillingPolicyDataSourceModel{
        //...
    })
}
```

## Fix

Preallocate the slice with the correct size to avoid repeated memory allocations:

```go
state.BillingPolicies = make([]BillingPolicyDataSourceModel, 0, len(policies))
for _, policy := range policies {
    state.BillingPolicies = append(state.BillingPolicies, BillingPolicyDataSourceModel{
        // ...
    })
}
```
