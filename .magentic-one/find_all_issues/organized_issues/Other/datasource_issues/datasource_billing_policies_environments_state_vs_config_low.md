# Title

Potential State/Config Inconsistency: State Read Before Config Attribute Read

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/datasource_billing_policies_environments.go

## Problem

In the `Read` method, the code first reads from `resp.State` into `state`, and only then reads the new value from `req.Config`. This can create confusion as to which source of truth is being used. In the context of a data source, current values should primarily come from `req.Config` and not stale/outdated `resp.State`. Reading from state is generally the pattern for resources to get persistent values, but for a data source, this can lead to subtle bugs or confusion under some future code change/refactor.

## Impact

May cause unexpected or hard-to-detect bugs if state becomes out-of-sync with the configuration, leading to stale or incorrect results being sent to the API on subsequent operations. This is a code smell rather than a breaking bug but could cause maintenance headaches down the line. **Severity: Low**

## Location

In the `Read` function:

## Code Issue

```go
var state BillingPoliciesEnvironmetsListDataSourceModel
resp.Diagnostics.Append(resp.State.Get(ctx, &state)...)
if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
	return
}

diag := req.Config.GetAttribute(ctx, path.Root("billing_policy_id"), &state.BillingPolicyId)
resp.Diagnostics.Append(diag...)
if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
	return
}
```

## Fix

For a data source, only read required arguments from `req.Config`. Reading previous state is unnecessary unless you are specifically supporting import or refresh semantics (rare for data sources).

```go
var state BillingPoliciesEnvironmetsListDataSourceModel

diag := req.Config.GetAttribute(ctx, path.Root("billing_policy_id"), &state.BillingPolicyId)
resp.Diagnostics.Append(diag...)
if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
	return
}
```

Make sure to update other attribute reads as necessary, and if state needs to be set later, do so only after all processing has resolved from the config.

I'll keep analyzing the file for further issues.
