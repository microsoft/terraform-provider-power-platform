# DTO Structs Lack Documentation

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/powerapps/dto.go

## Problem

The DTO structs and their fields lack documentation comments. In Go, it is beneficial to provide comments for exported types and those that are part of a public interface or library, as it assists with code readability, maintainability, and code generation tooling (e.g., `godoc`).

## Impact

Severity: Low

Lack of documentation reduces code self-descriptiveness, increasing onboarding time for new contributors and maintenance difficulty. It also reduces the utility of automatic documentation tools.

## Location

All DTO struct type definitions in this file.

## Code Issue

```go
type powerAppBapiDto struct {
    Name       string                    `json:"name"`
    Properties powerAppPropertiesBapiDto `json:"properties"`
}
// ... and similarly for all types
```

## Fix

Add comments explaining the purpose and relevant details for each struct and its fields.

```go
// PowerAppBapiDto represents the main DTO from the PowerApps API.
type PowerAppBapiDto struct {
    Name       string                    `json:"name"`        // Unique app identifier
    Properties PowerAppPropertiesBapiDto `json:"properties"`  // Properties of the Power App
}
```
