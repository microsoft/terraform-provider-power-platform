# Title

Potential Data Consistency Issue: Empty String Constants for `*_ANALYTICS_SCOPE`

##
/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/constants/constants.go

## Problem

The constants `CHINA_ANALYTICS_SCOPE`, `EX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE`, and `RX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE` are set to the empty string (`""`). This is likely to mean "no Analytics Scope available" for these regions, but it may cause issues if consuming code does not check for emptiness before usage, potentially leading to invalid requests or silent failures.

## Impact

Medium severity. If code attempts to use these constants as authentication scopes or includes them in a request without checking for the empty string, it may result in malformed requests, failed authentications, or subtle bugs.

## Location

```go
CHINA_ANALYTICS_SCOPE = ""
...
EX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE = ""
...
RX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE = ""
```

## Code Issue

```go
CHINA_ANALYTICS_SCOPE = ""
EX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE    = ""
RX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE    = ""
```

## Fix

Ensure that any code using these constants checks for the empty string and handles it gracefully (such as skipping optional scopes or reporting unsupported features in these clouds). If possible, use a comment to document intentionally missing scopes, or define a sentinel value.

Example:

```go
CHINA_ANALYTICS_SCOPE = "" // No analytics scope for China Cloud
EX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE    = "" // No analytics scope for EX Cloud
RX_ANALYTICS_SCOPE    = "" // No analytics scope for RX Cloud
```

Or, use a sentinel for unavailability:

```go
ANALYTICS_SCOPE_UNAVAILABLE = "<not-available>"
// Then set the values for these constants to ANALYTICS_SCOPE_UNAVAILABLE
```
