# Title

Constant Naming Convention Violates Go Standards

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/authorization/constants.go

## Problem

The constants `ROLE_ENVIRONMENT_ADMIN` and `ROLE_ENVIRONMENT_MAKER` are named using all-uppercase letters with underscores. Go style guidelines recommend using CamelCase for exported constants, i.e., `RoleEnvironmentAdmin` and `RoleEnvironmentMaker`.

## Impact

Adhering to Go naming conventions improves code readability and consistency across the codebase. Naming issues have a **medium** severity as improper naming rarely causes bugs, but it can hamper code understanding and maintenance, especially for teams.

## Location

Lines 4â€“8 in `/internal/services/authorization/constants.go`

## Code Issue

```go
const (
	ROLE_ENVIRONMENT_ADMIN = "Environment Admin"
	ROLE_ENVIRONMENT_MAKER = "Environment Maker"
)
```

## Fix

Rename the constants to use CamelCase as per Go standards. For exported constants, begin with a capital letter without underscores.

```go
const (
	RoleEnvironmentAdmin = "Environment Admin"
	RoleEnvironmentMaker = "Environment Maker"
)
```

This change brings the code inline with Go best practices for exported names.
