# Title

Ambiguous Attribute Typing: Use of Magic String and Implicit Typing in Schema

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/datasource_billing_policies_environments.go

## Problem

The schema definition for the `environments` attribute uses `types.StringType` directly as the `ElementType`. While `types.StringType` is a valid usage, using string literals (like `"billing_policy_id"`) and implicit typings without shared constants or types can lead to inconsistencies and bugs across a codebase.

## Impact

Direct usage of such magic strings and implicit types can result in attributes that are difficult to refactor, accidentally duplicated, or referenced with typos elsewhere. This is a maintainability and readability issue, which can become a real problem in larger codebases. **Severity: Low**

## Location

Schema definition in the `Schema` function:

## Code Issue

```go
"billing_policy_id": schema.StringAttribute{
	Required:            true,
	MarkdownDescription: "The id of the billing policy",
},
"environments": schema.SetAttribute{
	MarkdownDescription: "The environments associated with the billing policy",
	ElementType:         types.StringType,
	Computed:            true,
},
```

## Fix

Define constants for attribute names to improve discoverability and reduce the risk of typos, and consider (if applicable) using shared types or type aliases for `ElementType`:

```go
const (
	AttrBillingPolicyID = "billing_policy_id"
	AttrEnvironments    = "environments"
)

...

Attributes: map[string]schema.Attribute{
	AttrBillingPolicyID: schema.StringAttribute{
		Required:            true,
		MarkdownDescription: "The id of the billing policy",
	},
	AttrEnvironments: schema.SetAttribute{
		MarkdownDescription: "The environments associated with the billing policy",
		ElementType:         types.StringType,
		Computed:            true,
	},
}
```

This improves maintainability, refactorability, and consistency across the codebase.
