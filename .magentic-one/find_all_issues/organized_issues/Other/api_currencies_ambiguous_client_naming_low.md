# Title

Ambiguity in Naming of 'client' Type

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/currencies/api_currencies.go

## Problem

The struct type is named `client`, which is unexported and generic. In Go conventions and for code clarity, it's encouraged to use more descriptive struct names, especially in a package like `currencies` where there may be many types. `client` is also a common name in Go standard library and elsewhere, causing ambiguity when reading or searching code.

## Impact

**Low**. Mostly a maintainability and readability issue; confusion may occur when expanding codebase or performing code reviews.

## Location

Definition of the `client` struct:

```go
type client struct {
	Api *api.Client
}
```

## Fix

Rename the struct to be more specific, e.g., `CurrenciesClient`:

```go
type CurrenciesClient struct {
	Api *api.Client
}
```
Also update related functions and methods for consistency.
