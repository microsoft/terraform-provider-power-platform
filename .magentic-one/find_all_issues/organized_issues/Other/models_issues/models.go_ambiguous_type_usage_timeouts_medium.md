# Title

Ambiguous or Unclear Type Usage for timeouts.Value

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/admin_management_application/models.go

## Problem

The field `Timeouts` in `AdminManagementApplicationResourceModel` is typed as `timeouts.Value`. While this is a valid use if `timeouts.Value` is an explicit type, the code does not provide context for what properties are expected or what structure this represents. This can create maintainability and clarity concerns, especially if `timeouts.Value` is not a stable or official public-facing type from the Terraform plugin framework, or if it is meant to be a struct or a specialized type alias.

## Impact

Using an opaque or potentially unstable type as a model field can result in future compatibility issues, confusion for maintainers, or unexpected runtime behavior if the library's implementation changes. Severity: medium

## Location

Line 17, struct: `AdminManagementApplicationResourceModel`

## Code Issue

```go
type AdminManagementApplicationResourceModel struct {
	Timeouts timeouts.Value        `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
	Id       customtypes.UUIDValue `tfsdk:"id"`
}
```

## Fix

Explicitly define a struct or an alias that correctly represents the expected model for timeouts, or ensure that `timeouts.Value` is the correct, intended, and stable type from the dependency.

For example, if the intent is only to include some known timeout values as fields, define them concretely:

```go
type AdminManagementApplicationResourceModel struct {
	Timeouts struct {
		Create string
		Update string
		Delete string
	} `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
	Id customtypes.UUIDValue `tfsdk:"id"`
}
```

Alternatively, document and validate the use of `timeouts.Value` as appropriate, to clarify its intent and stability within the application's domain model.
