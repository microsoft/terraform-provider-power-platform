# Lack of Comments on Exported Types

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_templates/models.go

## Problem

Exported types such as `EnvironmentTemplatesDataSource`, `EnvironmentTemplatesDataSourceModel`, and `EnvironmentTemplatesDataModel` lack doc comments. This reduces the quality and usefulness of generated documentation (e.g., via GoDoc), making it harder for users and contributors to understand the purpose and usage of these types.

## Impact

Low to medium severity. This affects code maintainability, documentation, and onboarding.

## Location

```go
type EnvironmentTemplatesDataSource struct {
...
}

type EnvironmentTemplatesDataSourceModel struct {
...
}

type EnvironmentTemplatesDataModel struct {
...
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
type EnvironmentTemplatesDataSource struct {
...
}
```

## Fix

Add descriptive comments for every exported type, e.g.:

```go
// EnvironmentTemplatesDataSource is used to represent...
type EnvironmentTemplatesDataSource struct {
    ...
}
```
