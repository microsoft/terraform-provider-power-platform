# Inconsistent Naming Convention for Function Receiver

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/api_licensing.go

## Problem

The receiver name for the `Client` struct methods is `client` instead of the commonly recommended practice in Go of using a short, one- or two-letter variable (e.g., `c`). This is recommended for consistency, brevity, and to avoid confusion with the type name (`Client`).

## Impact

Low. This does not cause bugs, but it affects code readability and maintainability, especially for people familiar with common Go idioms and conventions.

## Location

Throughout file: All method receivers on `Client`.

## Code Issue

```go
func (client *Client) GetBillingPolicies(...)
func (client *Client) GetBillingPolicy(...)
...
func (client *Client) DoWaitForFinalStatus(...)
```

## Fix

Rename the receiver from `client` to `c` for all methods on the `Client` type. Example:

```go
func (c *Client) GetBillingPolicies(...)
func (c *Client) GetBillingPolicy(...)
...
func (c *Client) DoWaitForFinalStatus(...)
```
