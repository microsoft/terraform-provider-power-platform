# Structure: Missing Documentation and Export Comments

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/resource_environment_application_package_install.go

## Problem

The file defines a resource with several exported methods, but the file and most functions lack Go-style documentation comments (`// FunctionName ...`). Exported structs/methods should have comments describing their use to support proper linting, doc generation, and onboarding.

## Impact

Severity: **Low**

While this does not result in direct bugs, it impacts maintainability, hinders onboarding, and results in a poor developer experience in IDEs and documentation generation tools.

## Location

At the top of the file and preceding all exported resource methods, for example:

```go
func (r *EnvironmentApplicationPackageInstallResource) Metadata(ctx context.Context, req resource.MetadataRequest, resp *resource.MetadataResponse) {
    ...
}
```
(And all similar resource methods.)

## Code Issue

No Go-style comments for exported identifiers.

## Fix

Add a comment line preceding every exported method describing its purpose and behavior.

```go
// Metadata sets the resource type name and logs the operation.
func (r *EnvironmentApplicationPackageInstallResource) Metadata(ctx context.Context, req resource.MetadataRequest, resp *resource.MetadataResponse) {
    ...
}
```

Do this for each exported method and resource constructor.
