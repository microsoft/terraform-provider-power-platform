# Title

Lack of context propagation and insufficient information when initializing API client

##

internal/services/licensing/resource_billing_policy_environment.go

## Problem

In the `Configure` function, the `NewLicensingClient` is called with just `client.Api`. It is unclear whether `client.Api` includes all necessary context information, e.g., for propagating trace IDs, cancellation, or user context downstream. This could lead to missing critical information in external API calls (for auditing, distributed tracing, or debugging).

Also, the error handling for API initialization type assertion provides a general message but may not assist troubleshooting unless all context is properly included (e.g., logging the provider type name or additional debug data).

## Impact

Severity: low

While not always causing functional bugs, insufficient propagation of context and information to API clients can make debugging, auditing, or tracing requests much harder in distributed systems and cloud tools. If context is important for cancellation or timeouts, omitting it could lead to leaked connections or missed cancellations.

## Location

`Configure` method:

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
	resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
		"Unexpected ProviderData Type",
		fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
	)
	return
}
r.LicensingClient = NewLicensingClient(client.Api)
```

## Code Issue

```go
r.LicensingClient = NewLicensingClient(client.Api)
```

## Fix

Ensure that `client.Api` carries all the necessary context information (e.g., `context.Context`, trace IDs) or extend initialization to explicitly accept a context where appropriate. Consider logging additional details for easier troubleshooting and include relevant parts of `req` for diagnostic purposes.

```go
// Ensure context is propagated or passed where possible:
r.LicensingClient = NewLicensingClient(ctx, client.Api) // if supported

// Supplement: better error diagnostics
if !ok {
	tflog.Error(ctx, "Unexpected ProviderData Type in resource configuration", map[string]interface{}{
		"expected_type": "*api.ProviderClient",
		"actual_type":   fmt.Sprintf("%T", req.ProviderData),
		"provider_type": req.ProviderTypeName,
	})
	resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
		"Unexpected ProviderData Type",
		fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
	)
	return
}
```
