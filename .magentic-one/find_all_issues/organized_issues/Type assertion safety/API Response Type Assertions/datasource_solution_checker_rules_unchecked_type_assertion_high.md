# Title

Unchecked Type Assertion on ProviderData in Configure

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution_checker_rules/datasource_solution_checker_rules.go

## Problem

In the `Configure` method, there is a type assertion on `req.ProviderData` to `*api.ProviderClient`. If this assertion fails, an error is logged via `resp.Diagnostics.AddError` and the function returns. While a diagnostic is added, the code after this point assumes the type assertion has succeeded (e.g., subsequent usage of `client.Api`). This pattern, while accepted in Terraform providers, may lead to subtle failures if the error is not handled thoroughly downstream, or if additional initialization logic is added later. Defensive programming suggests treating failed type assertions as fatal errors or using more robust error handling.

## Impact

Potential for future control flow bugs or nil pointer dereference if refactoring occurs and additional code after the assertion assumes a valid client. Severity is **high**, since improper error handling here impacts provider setup, potentially resulting in failed provider initialization or misleading error messages.

## Location

Line starting:
```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
```

## Code Issue

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
        fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
    )
    return
}
d.SolutionCheckerRulesClient = newSolutionCheckerRulesClient(client.Api)
```

## Fix

Perform the assignment to `d.SolutionCheckerRulesClient` only if the assertion is successful, and consider adding a test for this branch. Document that a failed assertion is considered a terminal configuration error.

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
    resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
        "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
        fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
    )
    // Optionally: panic or return here, as expected.
    return
}
// Proceed safely knowing client is valid
if client != nil {
    d.SolutionCheckerRulesClient = newSolutionCheckerRulesClient(client.Api)
}
```
