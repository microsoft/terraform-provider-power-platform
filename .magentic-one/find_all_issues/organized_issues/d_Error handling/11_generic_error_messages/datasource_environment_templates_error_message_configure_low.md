# Title

Inconsistent error message formatting in `Configure` method

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_templates/datasource_environment_templates.go

## Problem

The error message in the `Configure` method, within the `AddError` call, is user-directed but loses some helpful information and its structure could be improved for consistency.

Currently:

```go
resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
    "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
    fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
)
```

## Impact

Severity: Low

- This is a usability and UX issue, but not strictly a correctness problem. Terse and actionable error messages improve developer experience.

## Location

Method `Configure`, in the block where `ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)` fails.

## Code Issue

```go
resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
    "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
    fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
)
```

## Fix

Expand the message with instructions, and structure it for clarity, for example:

```go
resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
    "Invalid Provider Configuration",
    fmt.Sprintf("The provider data was not of the expected type '*api.ProviderClient' (got: %T). "+
        "This is likely a bug in the provider. Please file a bug report with the configuration you used.", req.ProviderData),
)
```
