# Title

Potential Redundant Assignment of Id and EnvironmentId in State

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_settings/resources_environment_settings.go

## Problem

In the Create, Read, and Update methods, after converting DTOs to resource models, both `state.Id` and `state.EnvironmentId` are explicitly set to `plan.EnvironmentId` or `state.EnvironmentId`. This appears redundant given that these should already be set correctly from the DTO mapping function. This practice can mask errors in DTO-to-model conversion, causing maintainers to not notice bugs if the conversion is wrong.

## Impact

Assigning these fields redundantly may reduce code clarity and hide bugs in DTO conversion. The severity is low, but it affects maintainability and could delay debugging type mapping mistakes.

## Location

```go
	state, err := convertFromEnvironmentSettingsDto[EnvironmentSettingsResourceModel](envSettings, plan.Timeouts)
	if err != nil {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError("Error converting environment settings", err.Error())
		return
	}
	state.Id = plan.EnvironmentId
	state.EnvironmentId = plan.EnvironmentId
```

## Code Issue

```go
	state.Id = plan.EnvironmentId
	state.EnvironmentId = plan.EnvironmentId
```

## Fix

Remove the redundant assignment unless DTO conversion does not (and should not) update these fields. Instead, ensure that the `convertFromEnvironmentSettingsDto` sets them properly during mapping.

```go
	state, err := convertFromEnvironmentSettingsDto[EnvironmentSettingsResourceModel](envSettings, plan.Timeouts)
	if err != nil {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError("Error converting environment settings", err.Error())
		return
	}
	// Only set these fields here if there is a valid reason not to do so in conversion
```
Review and correct the DTO conversion if it does not set these essential identifiers correctly.
