# Title

Inconsistent and verbose type naming

##

internal/services/licensing/resource_billing_policy_environment.go

## Problem

The `BillingPolicyEnvironmentResource` and `BillingPolicyEnvironmentResourceModel` types use verbose and repetitive names that add clutter to the code and make it harder to scan. This is especially problematic because the context (i.e., this code is in a `licensing` resource file for billing policy environments) is already provided by the package and filename. 

The type names are unnecessarily long and include redundant suffixes such as `Resource` and `ResourceModel`. Additionally, exported constructor functions and receiver names (`r`) do not always match a single-character idiom or improve clarity.

## Impact

Severity: low

This decreases code readability and maintainability, and makes the code harder to scan and refactor. It also goes against Go naming conventions, which favor concise, descriptive, non-redundant names.

## Location

Types, constructors, and receivers throughout the file, for example:

```go
type BillingPolicyEnvironmentResource struct { ... }
type BillingPolicyEnvironmentResourceModel struct { ... }

func NewBillingPolicyEnvironmentResource() resource.Resource { ... }
```

## Code Issue

```go
type BillingPolicyEnvironmentResource struct { ... }
type BillingPolicyEnvironmentResourceModel struct { ... }

func NewBillingPolicyEnvironmentResource() resource.Resource { ... }
```

## Fix

Shorten type and function names to remove unnecessary suffixes and reduce repetition. Use idiomatic naming, leverage package context, and optionally include comments if clarification is needed.

```go
// Example improvements:
type EnvironmentResource struct { ... }
type EnvironmentModel struct { ... }

func NewEnvironmentResource() resource.Resource { ... }

// Receiver shortens to (e *EnvironmentResource)
func (e *EnvironmentResource) Create(...) { ... }
```

If the original names are needed for backwards compatibility, consider adding type aliases for new, cleaner names, while keeping the old names deprecated.
