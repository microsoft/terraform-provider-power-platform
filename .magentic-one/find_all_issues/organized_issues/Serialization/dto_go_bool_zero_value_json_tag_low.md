# Boolean Field with `omitempty` Tag

## /workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/dto.go

## Problem

Several boolean fields are tagged with `omitempty` in their JSON struct tags (e.g., `BingChatEnabled bool `json:"bingChatEnabled,omitempty"``). In Go, a boolean's zero value is `false`, and when using `omitempty`, a `false` value omits the field from encoded JSON. This can cause unintentional absence of the field, which could be ambiguous for API consumers.

## Impact

Leads to ambiguity between `false` (explicit) and the field not being set at all, especially when the DTO evolves or is consumed by other systems. This is generally a **low** severity issue but can lead to subtle bugs or misinterpretation of the data in some APIs.

## Location

- E.g., `BingChatEnabled` in multiple structs including `EnviromentPropertiesDto`, `GenerativeAiFeaturesPropertiesDto`, etc.

## Code Issue

```go
BingChatEnabled bool `json:"bingChatEnabled,omitempty"`
```

## Fix

Consider making boolean fields pointers (`*bool`) to distinguish unset from false:

```go
BingChatEnabled *bool `json:"bingChatEnabled,omitempty"`
```

If API compatibility allows, refactor accordingly.
