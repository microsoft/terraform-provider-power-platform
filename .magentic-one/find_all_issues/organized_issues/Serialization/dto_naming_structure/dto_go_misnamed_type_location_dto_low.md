# Type Naming Consistency: LocationDto `ID` field

## /workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/dto.go

## Problem

Within the `LocationDto` struct, the field representing the identifier is named `ID` (all uppercase), while other places in the file typically use `Id` (capital "I" followed by lowercase "d"). This is a common convention dilemma in Go, but it is best to stick with one approach within the YAML/JSON mapping context (as well as codebase) for searchability and clarity.

## Impact

This can lead to confusion and errors when marshalling/unmarshalling data if the convention is not consistently followed. It is also inconsistent with other DTOs' conventions in this file.
Severity: **low**.

## Location

- `LocationDto` struct, line ~288

## Code Issue

```go
type LocationDto struct {
    ID         string                `json:"id"`
    Type       string                `json:"type"`
    Name       string                `json:"name"`
    Properties LocationPropertiesDto `json:"properties"`
}
```

## Fix

Pick a standard (either `ID` or `Id`) for the entire codebase and stick to it. In this file, the majority of DTOs use `Id`. Example:

```go
type LocationDto struct {
    Id         string                `json:"id"`
    Type       string                `json:"type"`
    Name       string                `json:"name"`
    Properties LocationPropertiesDto `json:"properties"`
}
```

Or, if you choose `ID`, update all other occurrences in the codebase accordingly.
