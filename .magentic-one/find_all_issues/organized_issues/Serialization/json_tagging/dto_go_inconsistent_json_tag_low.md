# Inconsistent JSON Tag Naming

## /workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/dto.go

## Problem

In the `LinkedEnvironmentMetadataDto` struct, the field `Templates` uses the JSON tag `template` (singular), while the Go type is a slice (`[]string`). The plural/singular inconsistency is confusing. It is conventional and expected that slicing types use pluralized JSON tags.

## Impact

This minor issue affects clarity for anyone interacting with the API, as consumers will expect the JSON property for a list to be plural (i.e., `templates`). While not a breaking issue (if handled carefully in both serialization and documentation), it is an easy source of misunderstanding. Severity: **low**.

## Location

- `LinkedEnvironmentMetadataDto` struct, field `Templates` around line 118

## Code Issue

```go
Templates []string `json:"template,omitempty"`
```

## Fix

Use the plural `templates` to match the Go type:

```go
Templates []string `json:"templates,omitempty"`
```
