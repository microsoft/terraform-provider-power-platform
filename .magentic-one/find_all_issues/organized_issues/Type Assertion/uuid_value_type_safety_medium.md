# Equality Method Type Assertion Can Fail for Pointer Receiver

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/customtypes/uuid_value.go

## Problem

In the `Equal` method, the code attempts to cast the provided `attr.Value` to `UUIDValue` with the following assertion:

```go
other, ok := o.(UUIDValue)
```

However, this will fail if `o` is a pointer to a `UUIDValue`. In Go, if the value passed is of type `*UUIDValue`, this assertion will return false, potentially causing equality checks to fail unexpectedly. Since Terraform frameworks often pass around values as either structs or pointers, using a pointer receiver (or handling both cases) is recommended.

## Impact

**Medium Severity**: Incorrect equality checks may result in subtle bugs where UUIDs that are ostensibly the same are not considered equal, causing resource drift detection and other logic relying on equality to malfunction.

## Location

Method `Equal` in `UUIDValue`

## Code Issue

```go
func (v UUIDValue) Equal(o attr.Value) bool {
	other, ok := o.(UUIDValue)
	if !ok {
		return false
	}

	return v.StringValue.Equal(other.StringValue)
}
```

## Fix

Change to support both `UUIDValue` and `*UUIDValue` for comparison, or always use pointers consistently throughout your codebase. Here's a recommended fix:

```go
func (v UUIDValue) Equal(o attr.Value) bool {
	switch other := o.(type) {
	case UUIDValue:
		return v.StringValue.Equal(other.StringValue)
	case *UUIDValue:
		if other == nil {
			return false
		}
		return v.StringValue.Equal(other.StringValue)
	default:
		return false
	}
}
```
