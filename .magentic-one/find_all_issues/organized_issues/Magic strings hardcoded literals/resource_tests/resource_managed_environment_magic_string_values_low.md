# Title

Magic strings for settings values reduce code clarity and future expansion

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/resource_managed_environment.go

## Problem

In several places, hardcoded string literals like "true", "false", and settings values such as "Standard" populate the configuration DTOs and resource state. Using magic strings can reduce code clarity, increase the risk of typos, and make maintenance or refactoring harder (if the meaning or valid values change). Ideally, these string values should be constants or enums for easy replacement, reuse, and discoverability.

## Impact

Low. This impacts maintainability and code clarity, but does not cause immediate runtime errors if all strings remain valid and consistent.

## Location

Within Create, Update, and other DTO setup locations:

## Code Issue

```go
ProtectionLevel: "Standard",
IncludeOnHomepageInsights: "false",
DisableAiGeneratedDescriptions: "false",
// many similar instances ...
```

## Fix

Define constants at the top of the file:

```go
const (
    ProtectionLevelStandard = "Standard"
    IncludeOnHomepageInsightsFalse = "false"
    DisableAiGeneratedDescriptionsFalse = "false"
)
```
And reference them throughout the code. Optionally, group them under type aliases or enums for even better clarity and refactorability.
