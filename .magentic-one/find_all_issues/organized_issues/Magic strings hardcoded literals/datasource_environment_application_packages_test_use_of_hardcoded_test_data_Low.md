# Use of Hardcoded Test Data in Test Configuration

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/datasource_environment_application_packages_test.go

## Problem

The test cases use hardcoded values for resources and data sources, such as specific GUIDs and display names, which reduces the flexibility and maintainability of the test cases. This can make updates more difficult if the underlying data changes. It also makes parallelization and test isolation harder.

## Impact

Severity: Low

Using static values for identifiers and resource names can interfere with other tests running in parallel, may mask real failures, and increases maintenance effort as changes are needed across the tests if the specifics change.

## Location

Lines throughout test cases, e.g.:

```go
display_name      = "` + mocks.TestName() + `"
location          = "unitedstates"
environment_type  = "Sandbox"
// ...
security_group_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

## Fix

Generate dynamic test data where possible by using helper functions or introducing variables. For example, you may create random identifiers or use `mocks.TestName()` consistently for all identifiers.

```go
display_name      = "` + mocks.TestName() + `"
location          = "${var.test_location}"
environment_type  = "Sandbox"
dataverse = {
    language_code     = "1033"
    currency_code     = "USD"
    security_group_id = "${var.test_security_group_id}"
}
```

Define and use variables or helper methods to create test-specific, unique values.
