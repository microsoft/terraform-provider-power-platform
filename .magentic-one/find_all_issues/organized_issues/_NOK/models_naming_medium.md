# Title

Redundant and Verbose Naming in Type Definitions

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_group_rule_set/models.go

## Problem

Several type names in this file are verbose and repetitive, using the full prefix `environmentGroupRuleSet...` instead of adopting more concise, Go-idiomatic naming. For example, `environmentGroupRuleSetResourceModel` could be simplified to `RuleSetResourceModel`. This makes the code harder to read and maintain, especially as the file grows.

## Impact

Medium: Excessive verbosity can reduce code readability, hinder maintainers, and cause visual clutter. While it does not impact runtime, it increases cognitive load.

## Location

Type definitions, throughout the file. Example:

```go
type environmentGroupRuleSetResourceModel struct {
	Timeouts           timeouts.Value `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
	Id                 types.String   `tfsdk:"id"`
	EnvironmentGroupId types.String   `tfsdk:"environment_group_id"`
	Rules              types.Object   `tfsdk:"rules"`
}
```

## Fix

Refactor type names to be shorter and more Go-idiomatic. For example:

```go
type RuleSetResourceModel struct {
	Timeouts           timeouts.Value `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
	Id                 types.String   `tfsdk:"id"`
	EnvironmentGroupId types.String   `tfsdk:"environment_group_id"`
	Rules              types.Object   `tfsdk:"rules"`
}
```

Repeat for the other types (e.g., `SharingControlsModel`, `UsageInsightsModel`, etc.).
