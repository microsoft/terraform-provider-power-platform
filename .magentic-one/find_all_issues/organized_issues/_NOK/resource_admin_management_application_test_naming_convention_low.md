# Test Function Naming Convention Inconsistency

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/admin_management_application/resource_admin_management_application_test.go

## Problem

The test function is named `TestUnitAdminManagementApplicationResource_Validate_Create`, which introduces a custom prefix (`TestUnit...`). According to Go conventions, test function names should begin with `Test` directly followed by a descriptive name relevant to what is being tested, but custom prefixes like “Unit” or “Acc” do not align with standard Go practices and may confuse test discovery tools, linters, or new contributors.

In the same file, there’s a `TestAccAdminManagementApplicationResource_Validate_Create`. While the “Acc” prefix is sometimes used informally for acceptance tests, it is not an official Go convention. Consistency and conventional naming improve maintainability.

## Impact

- **Severity: Low**
- Non-standard naming can lead to confusion, particularly for new contributors.
- It may affect integration with specific tooling.
- Impacts readability and maintainability.

## Location

```go
func TestAccAdminManagementApplicationResource_Validate_Create(t *testing.T)
func TestUnitAdminManagementApplicationResource_Validate_Create(t *testing.T)
```

## Code Issue

```go
func TestUnitAdminManagementApplicationResource_Validate_Create(t *testing.T) {
...
}
```

## Fix

Rename test functions to use standard Go conventions, for example:

```go
func TestAdminManagementApplicationResourceValidateCreate(t *testing.T) {
    ...
}
```
And for acceptance tests, use comments (or subtests) to clarify test purposes, rather than non-standard prefixes.
