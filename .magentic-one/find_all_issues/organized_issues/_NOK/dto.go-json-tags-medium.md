# Ambiguous Use of JSON Tags for Consistency

##

internal/services/copilot_studio_application_insights/dto.go

## Problem

There is inconsistency in the use of JSON tags within the struct definitions, especially concerning the casing and naming (e.g., `environmentId`, `botId`, vs. `"microsoft.PowerVirtualAgents"`), which may not be consistent with API payloads. Furthermore, the use of a period in the JSON tag for `PowerVirtualAgents` (i.e., `"microsoft.PowerVirtualAgents"`) is uncommon and may cause issues with some (un)marshal implementations.

## Impact

Potential serialization issues or client/server contract mismatches. May result in reduced interoperability or subtle bugs during (un)marshalling or when integrating with external systems. Severity: **medium**.

## Location

Lines: e.g., 29

## Code Issue

```go
PowerVirtualAgents string `json:"microsoft.PowerVirtualAgents"`
```

## Fix

Ensure that all JSON tags match the expected schema, and avoid using periods unless the payload absolutely requires it. If periods are required, verify compatibility, otherwise, use underscores or camelCase for consistency.

```go
PowerVirtualAgents string `json:"powerVirtualAgents"`
```

If `microsoft.PowerVirtualAgents` is required by API, document it clearly; otherwise, use consistent naming.
