# Title
Type assertion without error handling or fallback for ProviderData

##
/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connection/resource_connection.go

## Problem
In the `Configure` method, the code performs a type assertion on `req.ProviderData`:

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
```

If this assertion fails, it triggers an error in diagnostics and returns. However, there is no fallback or recovery mechanism, nor is a clear explanation provided to future maintainers for the handling of alternative/bogus types. This could cause misconfiguration or subtle bugs with future provider changes.

## Impact
High: Failure in type assertion without more detailed logging or alternatives makes debugging provider initialization issues difficult and can cause provider initialization to fail silently for users if the wrong type is ever passed.

## Location
Configure method, near:

## Code Issue
```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
  resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
    "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
    fmt.Sprintf("Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T. Please report this issue to the provider developers.", req.ProviderData),
  )
  return
}
```

## Fix
Improve logging to include the faulty value, and optionally consider a recover mechanism (panic if critical), or document why alternative types might occur. Log more details for debugging:

```go
client, ok := req.ProviderData.(*api.ProviderClient)
if !ok {
  resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
    "Unexpected ProviderData Type",
    fmt.Sprintf(
      "Expected *api.ProviderClient, got: %T (value: %v). This is likely a provider bugâ€”please report it.",
      req.ProviderData, req.ProviderData,
    ),
  )
  return
}
```

If more robust recovery or fallback becomes possible, add it here with documentation.
