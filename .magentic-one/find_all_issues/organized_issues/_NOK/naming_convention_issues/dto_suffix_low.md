# Title

Redundant Naming Suffix: `Dto` in Struct Names

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/dto.go

## Problem

Struct names throughout the file have the suffix `Dto` (e.g., `BillingPolicyDto`). In Go, such suffixes are generally considered redundant if the type is already placed in a DTO (Data Transfer Object) package or context. This can clutter type names and reduce code clarity.

## Impact

Reduces code readability and goes against idiomatic Go naming best practices. The severity is **low**, as it mainly affects readability and maintainability, not runtime operation.

## Location

All struct names (e.g., `BillingInstrumentDto`, `BillingPolicyDto`, etc.)

## Code Issue

```go
type BillingPolicyDto struct { ... }
type BillingPolicyCreateDto struct { ... }
type BillingInstrumentDto struct { ... }
type BillingPolicyArrayDto struct { ... }
...
```

## Fix

Remove the `Dto` suffix from all struct type names, unless the context makes it ambiguous otherwise.

```go
type BillingPolicy struct { ... }
type BillingPolicyCreate struct { ... }
type BillingInstrument struct { ... }
type BillingPolicyArray struct { ... }
...
```

If you wish to keep them for explicit distinction, ensure it is a deliberate, project-wide style (and justify in documentation). Otherwise, prefer simple, clear names.
