# Title

Ambiguity in AnalyticsRegionURLs Map for Special US Sectors

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/analytics_data_export/api_analytics_data_exports.go

## Problem

The region map includes `"GOV"`, `"HIGH"`, and `"DOD"` with `.us` and `.appsplatform.us` domains. These represent special US government and defense sectors but are documented only by their key strings. If usage or handling for these sectors differs, itâ€™s not obvious in the code (commenting/synonyms, or validation is missing).

## Impact

Potential for user confusion and handling errors. If synonyms or distinctions are not documented and logic for these regions may require special treatment, mistakes may occur later. Severity: Low.

## Location

```go
		"GOV":  "https://gcc.csanalytics.powerplatform.microsoft.us/",
		"HIGH": "https://high.csanalytics.powerplatform.microsoft.us/",
		"DOD":  "https://dod.csanalytics.csanalytics.appsplatform.us/",
```

## Code Issue

```go
		"GOV":  "https://gcc.csanalytics.powerplatform.microsoft.us/",
		"HIGH": "https://high.csanalytics.powerplatform.microsoft.us/",
		"DOD":  "https://dod.csanalytics.csanalytics.appsplatform.us/",
```

## Fix

Consider one or more of the following:
- Add clarifying comments above these mappings documenting what `GOV`, `HIGH`, and `DOD` represent.
- Validate and document expected usage and handling in consumer code and tests.
- If synonyms apply, make explicit synonym logic as with `"CH"`/`"CHE"` elsewhere.

Example comment:

```go
// Special US government/defense regions:
// GOV  = US GCC
// HIGH = US GCC High
// DOD  = US Department of Defense
var analyticsRegionURLs = map[string]string{ ... }
```
