# Title

Potential Loss of Type Safety for Rules Field

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_group_rule_set/models.go

## Problem

The `Rules` field in the `environmentGroupRuleSetResourceModel` struct is defined as a `types.Object`, which allows any object to be set. This sacrifices compile-time type safety and validation provided by Go, making it harder to ensure the structure and validity of the value assigned to `Rules`.

## Impact

Medium: Lack of compile-time type safety can lead to bugs and increases the need for runtime checks or error handling. It may cause maintenance issues as the schema evolves.

## Location

```go
type environmentGroupRuleSetResourceModel struct {
	Timeouts           timeouts.Value `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
	Id                 types.String   `tfsdk:"id"`
	EnvironmentGroupId types.String   `tfsdk:"environment_group_id"`
	Rules              types.Object   `tfsdk:"rules"`
}
```

## Fix

Define and use a typed struct for the expected contents of `Rules`, and update the model and usage accordingly for improved type checking and developer experience.

```go
type RuleSetRules struct {
	// Define expected fields here, e.g.:
	// ShareMode types.String `tfsdk:"share_mode"`
	// ...
}

type environmentGroupRuleSetResourceModel struct {
	Timeouts           timeouts.Value `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
	Id                 types.String   `tfsdk:"id"`
	EnvironmentGroupId types.String   `tfsdk:"environment_group_id"`
	Rules              RuleSetRules   `tfsdk:"rules"`
}
```

Update the codebase to map this schema appropriately.
