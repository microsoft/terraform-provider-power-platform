# Incorrect Path Handling: Missing Leading Slash in URL Path

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_groups/api_environment_group.go

## Problem

In `GetEnvironmentsInEnvironmentGroup`, the `apiUrl.Path` does not start with a `/`, while all the other endpoints do. This inconsistency may lead to path join errors and incorrect URLs, depending on the `net/url` behavior. The produced URL might be concatenated with the base path unexpectedly.

## Impact

Potential for malformed URLs sent to the API, leading to possible HTTP 404 or 400 errors or faulty API calls at runtime.

**Severity:** Medium

## Location

```go
apiUrl := &url.URL{
	Scheme: constants.HTTPS,
	Host:   client.Api.GetConfig().Urls.BapiUrl,
	Path:   "providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/scopes/admin/environments",
}
```

## Fix

Add a leading slash to the path:

```go
apiUrl := &url.URL{
	Scheme: constants.HTTPS,
	Host:   client.Api.GetConfig().Urls.BapiUrl,
	Path:   "/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/scopes/admin/environments",
}
```
