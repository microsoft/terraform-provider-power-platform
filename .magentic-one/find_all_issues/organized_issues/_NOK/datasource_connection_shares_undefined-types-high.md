# Ambiguous slice/model types for state and returned DTOs

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connection/datasource_connection_shares.go

## Problem

The conversion loop and the state setting rely on types like `SharesListDataSourceModel` and `SharesDataSourceModel`, but these types are not defined or imported in this file. Their absence makes it difficult to validate the correctness and type safety of model transforms, and casts doubt on the stability of the logic.

## Impact

**Severity: high**

If these types are undefined or incorrectly scoped, deploying or compiling the provider will fail, and contributors will be unable to reason about the transformation logic without cross-referencing other files, reducing maintainability.

## Location

```go
var state SharesListDataSourceModel
...
state.Shares = append(state.Shares, connectionModel)
```

## Code Issue

```go
var state SharesListDataSourceModel
```

## Fix

Explicitly import or define these types in this file, or ensure their presence in the same package and that their intended purpose is clear. Example stub (adjust to actual struct content):

```go
type SharesListDataSourceModel struct {
	EnvironmentId types.String `tfsdk:"environment_id"`
	ConnectorName types.String `tfsdk:"connector_name"`
	ConnectionId  types.String `tfsdk:"connection_id"`
	Shares        []SharesDataSourceModel `tfsdk:"shares"`
}

type SharesDataSourceModel struct {
	Id        types.String
	RoleName  types.String
	Principal struct {
		DisplayName types.String
		EntraId     types.String
	}
}
```
