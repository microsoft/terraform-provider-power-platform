# Title

Potential Redundancy and Documentation Issues in Cloud Environment Constants

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/constants/constants.go

## Problem

The code block has several large constant groups that follow a pattern for each cloud environment (PUBLIC, USDOD, USGOV, USGOVHIGH, CHINA, EX, RX), each with a set of related endpoints. The visual pattern is useful, but there's a risk that new regions could be added incorrectly, details might diverge from actual product environments, or documentation could drift from the code, as becomes evident with the comments and the table at the top going out of sync with the actual constants.

Also, having large, repetitive constant blocks can make maintenance hard and increases risk of copy-paste errors (some are already present). There's no central data structure to validate that all required endpoints are present for any new cloud, and no comments at the constant level to clarify the mapping to "Clouds" (besides the initial table which can get out of date).

## Impact

Low severity but important for maintainability. As cloud topologies and endpoints evolve, this bulk-of-constants structure encourages gradual decay and makes errors (e.g. copy/paste) or gaps in coverage more likely. Lack of in-place documentation means new contributors may struggle to determine which constant belongs to which environment, and future additions may be inconsistent.

## Location

The constant groups for each cloud (blocks beginning with `PUBLIC_`, `USDOD_`, etc) and the undocumented mapping between the table and the constants.

## Code Issue

```go
const (
	PUBLIC_ADMIN_POWER_PLATFORM_URL     = "api.admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com"
	PUBLIC_OAUTH_AUTHORITY_URL          = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/"
	// ...
)
const (
	USDOD_ADMIN_POWER_PLATFORM_URL     = "api.admin.appsplatform.us"
	// ...
)
...
```
(Likewise for all other regions.)

## Fix

- Add explicit and machine-readable mappings between cloud codes and their endpoint sets, e.g. a struct or a map rather than repeated constant groups.
- Keep region table documentation directly above each relevant constant block, or generate documentation automatically from a data structure.
- For more maintainable code, consider something like:
  ```go
  type CloudEndpoints struct {
      AdminPowerPlatformURL     string
      OAuthAuthorityURL         string
      ...
  }

  var CloudEnvironments = map[string]CloudEndpoints{
      "Public": { ... },
      "USDoD": { ... },
      ...
  }
  ```
- Add comments on each block or field indicating how it maps to either the official region list or the published documentation.
