# Title

Structs Lack Documentation Comments

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_group_rule_set/models.go

## Problem

None of the struct types in this file have Go documentation comments. Go best practices recommend that all exported (and ideally even unexported) types are documented with comments. This facilitates IDE tooling and improves maintainability and onboarding for other developers, especially as your domain model grows.

## Impact

Low to Medium: Lack of documentation does not impact code execution but reduces accessibility for future maintainers, decreases self-documentation, and will be flagged by most Go linters (e.g., `golint`).

## Location

At the definition of all struct types, e.g.:

```go
type environmentGroupRuleSetResourceModel struct {
	Timeouts           timeouts.Value `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
	Id                 types.String   `tfsdk:"id"`
	EnvironmentGroupId types.String   `tfsdk:"environment_group_id"`
	Rules              types.Object   `tfsdk:"rules"`
}
```

## Fix

Provide Go-style comments above each struct and field, briefly describing their purpose. For example:

```go
// environmentGroupRuleSetResourceModel represents the schema for a rule set resource.
type environmentGroupRuleSetResourceModel struct {
	// Timeouts specifies resource operation timeouts.
	Timeouts timeouts.Value `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
	// Id is the resource ID.
	Id types.String `tfsdk:"id"`
	// EnvironmentGroupId is the associated group ID.
	EnvironmentGroupId types.String `tfsdk:"environment_group_id"`
	// Rules contains the rules object.
	Rules types.Object `tfsdk:"rules"`
}
```

This will aid code readability, navigation, and tooling.
