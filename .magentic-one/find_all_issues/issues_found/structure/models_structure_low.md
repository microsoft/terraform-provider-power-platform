# Ambiguous type alias for OrganizationsArrayDto (use of array type alias can degrade readability)

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_wave/models.go

## Problem

The type `OrganizationsArrayDto` is defined as a direct alias to a slice of `OrganizationDto`:

```go
type OrganizationsArrayDto []OrganizationDto
```

This aliasing without a struct wrapper diminishes explicitness and can confuse readers and maintainers. Using a struct wrapping the slice is the norm when following idiomatic Go, which aids in extensibility (future fields, methods) and discoverability. Furthermore, such slice type aliases do not provide meaning on their own (it's just a slice of a given type), which can hamper code structure as the project grows.

## Impact

- **Severity**: Low  
- Reduces code clarity for consumers who encounter this type.
- May make it harder to extend and maintain in the future.
- The risk is minor given current use, but could bring issues with code structure/maintainability down the line.

## Location

- `type OrganizationsArrayDto []OrganizationDto` toward the end of the file.

## Code Issue

```go
type OrganizationsArrayDto []OrganizationDto
```

## Fix

Wrap the slice in a struct (similarly to how `FeaturesArrayDto` is defined), enabling extensibility and greater clarity:

```go
type OrganizationsArrayDto struct {
    Values []OrganizationDto `json:"values"`
}
```

This matches the pattern used in `FeaturesArrayDto` and keeps things idiomatic and explicit. It also allows you to add fields (such as metadata, nextPage tokens, etc.) in the future if the structure expands.
