# Title

Unused import: "time"

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/constants/constants.go

## Problem

The file imports the `"time"` package but only uses it in a single constant definition for arithmetic multiplication (`DEFAULT_RESOURCE_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_IN_MINUTES = 20 * time.Minute`). If this pattern is widespread and more time-based constants might be needed, it is acceptable; but if this is the only use, consider whether a literal value would suffice or if `"time"` is really required.

## Impact

Low severity. It does not affect runtime but can cause unnecessary dependencies in the binary if unused elsewhere or if this is the only use and the constant is not required at runtime. It also adds minimal clutter to the imports section.

## Location

Top of the file:

```go
import "time"
```

## Code Issue

```go
import "time"
...
const (
	DEFAULT_RESOURCE_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_IN_MINUTES = 20 * time.Minute
)
```

## Fix

If you anticipate more time-based durations or want to keep the time unit clear, you may leave this as is. If this is the only use and you want to minimize dependencies, you could replace it with the literal value (in nanoseconds via int64) and remove the `"time"` import:

```go
// Remove the import if not needed elsewhere:
// import "time"

// Use the literal value (20 minutes in nanoseconds):
const (
	DEFAULT_RESOURCE_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_IN_MINUTES = 1200000000000 // 20 * 60 * 1e9 nanoseconds
)
// Or, if you prefer seconds or string (depending on how this is used elsewhere)
```

---

If you keep `"time"`, ensure that the rest of the codebase derives benefit from expressing times in this way. If not, prefer clarity and minimize extra imports.
