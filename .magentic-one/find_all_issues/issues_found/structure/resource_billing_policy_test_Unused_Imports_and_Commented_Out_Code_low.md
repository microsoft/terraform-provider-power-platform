# Unused Imports and Commented Out Code

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/licensing/resource_billing_policy_test.go

## Problem

The file contains large blocks of commented-out code (for example, for timeout tests) and potentially unused imports.

## Impact

- **Readability**: Distraction for reviewers and maintainers.
- **Cleanliness**: Increases file size without utility.

**Severity: Low**

## Location

Near the bottom of the file:

```go
// commenting out until we can properly test timeouts
//
// func TestUnitTestBillingPolicy_Validate_Create_TimeoutWithoutFinalStatus(t *testing.T) { ... }
```

## Code Issue

Block of commented-out test function and its body.

## Fix

Delete commented code. Use Git history for retrieval if needed in the future. For any feature in-progress, use a dedicated feature branch.
