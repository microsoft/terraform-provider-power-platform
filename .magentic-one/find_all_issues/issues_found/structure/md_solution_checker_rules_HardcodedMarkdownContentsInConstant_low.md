# Title

Hardcoded Markdown Contents in a Constant

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/md_solution_checker_rules.go

## Problem

The file defines a large Markdown document as a string constant (`SolutionCheckerMarkdown`). This content, which is essentially documentation, is hardcoded directly in the Go source file. This practice makes maintenance more cumbersome if updates are needed (for example, to add, remove, or edit rules) and increases the size and noise in the code file. It is uncommon to store extensive documentation as a string constant; typically such documentation would be provided as a standalone markdown file within the repository or embedded using asset/resource tools if required at runtime.

## Impact

- **Maintainability:** Difficult for developers to update or review documentation; increases risk of typos or inconsistencies.
- **Readability:** The code is much harder to read, as real logic (if any) is lost in the noise of the large constant.
- **Testing & Versioning:** Changes to the documentation now change Go code, which is tracked differently from documentation changes by tooling and code owners.
- **Reusability:** The Markdown document cannot be easily reused elsewhere (for example, in project documentation sites).

Severity: **Low** (Does not affect runtime, but hurts maintainability and project health)

## Location

File start to end (entire file is the declaration and contents of the constant)

## Code Issue

````go
const SolutionCheckerMarkdown = `
# Solution Checker Rules

... (hundreds of lines of Markdown omitted for brevity)
`
````

## Fix

Move the Markdown document to a standalone `.md` file (e.g., `SOLUTION_CHECKER_RULES.md`) in an appropriate location in your repository. If the documentation needs to be available as a string in Go, use Go embedding (with `//go:embed` for Go 1.16+) to load it at runtime. This maintains separation of concerns and keeps code clean.

````go
//go:embed SOLUTION_CHECKER_RULES.md
var SolutionCheckerMarkdown string
````

1. Create a file named `SOLUTION_CHECKER_RULES.md` in the same or an appropriate directory and move the Markdown content to it.
2. Use Go embedding as shown above to make it available as a variable at runtime.
3. Update any references to use the variable.

A markdown file with this content will be saved under the "structure" category as it relates to code maintainability and structure.
