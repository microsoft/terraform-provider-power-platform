# Title

Potential GoDoc and code structure improvement (missing comments on exported functions/types)

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connection/resource_connection_share.go

## Problem

Many exported functions, types, and methods (`NewConnectionShareResource`, `ShareResource` methods) lack GoDoc comments, making code less maintainable and less clear to new contributors.

## Impact

Impact is **low**, but this affects maintainability, readability, and is a common best practice in modern Go codebases.

## Location

Throughout the file, notably on exported methods and constructors.

## Code Issue

```go
func NewConnectionShareResource() resource.Resource {
	return &ShareResource{
		TypeInfo: helpers.TypeInfo{
			TypeName: "connection_share",
		},
	}
}
```

## Fix

Add GoDoc comments to all exported types and functions for clarity.

```go
// NewConnectionShareResource creates a new instance of the ShareResource for managing connection shares.
func NewConnectionShareResource() resource.Resource {
	// ...
}
```

And for methods:

```go
// Metadata sets the resource type name for the provider and logs debug information.
func (r *ShareResource) Metadata(ctx context.Context, req resource.MetadataRequest, resp *resource.MetadataResponse) {
	// ...
}
```
