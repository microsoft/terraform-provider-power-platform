# Structs Missing Documentation Comments

application/models.go

## Problem

Most structs in the file (e.g., `TenantApplicationPackagesDataSource`, `TenantApplicationPackagesListDataSourceModel`, etc.) are missing documentation comments. Go best practices recommend that every exported type and field have a leading comment describing its purpose.

## Impact

Lack of documentation reduces code readability and maintainability, especially for new team members or for public modules. It also negatively affects GoDoc generation and automated code review tools.  
Severity: Low

## Location

All struct definitions in this file.

## Code Issue

```go
type TenantApplicationPackagesListDataSourceModel struct {
	Timeouts      timeouts.Value                            `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
	Name          types.String                              `tfsdk:"name"`
	PublisherName types.String                              `tfsdk:"publisher_name"`
	Applications  []TenantApplicationPackageDataSourceModel `tfsdk:"applications"`
}
```

## Fix

Add descriptive comments above each struct and exported field:

```go
// TenantApplicationPackagesListDataSourceModel represents a collection of application packages for a tenant.
type TenantApplicationPackagesListDataSourceModel struct {
	// Timeouts specifies operation-specific timeouts for the resource.
	Timeouts      timeouts.Value                            `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
	// Name is the name of the application.
	Name          types.String                              `tfsdk:"name"`
	// PublisherName is the name of the publisher for the application.
	PublisherName types.String                              `tfsdk:"publisher_name"`
	// Applications is the list of application packages.
	Applications  []TenantApplicationPackageDataSourceModel `tfsdk:"applications"`
}
```
