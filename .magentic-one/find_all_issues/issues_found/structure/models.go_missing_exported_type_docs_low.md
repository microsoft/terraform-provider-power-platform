# Title

Missing Documentation for Exported Types and Functions

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution/models.go

## Problem

The exported types (e.g., `DataSource`, `DataSourceModel`, `ResourceModel`, etc.) and public functions lack Go-style doc comments. This violates Go best practices and hinders code readability and maintainability, especially for consumers outside the immediate development team.

## Impact

Low. While this does not introduce runtime bugs, it impairs code discoverability by tools like `godoc`, resulting in a steeper learning curve for new contributors and users.

## Location

- All exported types, structs, and functions in this file

## Code Issue

```go
type DataSource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	SolutionClient Client
}

// ...
func convertFromSolutionDto(solutionDto SolutionDto) DataSourceModel { ... }
```

## Fix

Add Go-style doc comments for all exported types and functions to improve documentation and usability.

```go
// DataSource represents a data source for solutions.
type DataSource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	SolutionClient Client
}

// convertFromSolutionDto converts a SolutionDto into a DataSourceModel.
func convertFromSolutionDto(solutionDto SolutionDto) DataSourceModel { ... }
```
