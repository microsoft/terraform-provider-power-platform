# Title

Unused HTTP Response Value from API Call

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/locations/api_locations.go

## Problem

The unused HTTP response value returned by `client.Api.Execute` may leave out valuable information (headers, status code) or error handling opportunities.

## Impact

Low severity. While not always critical, it is generally better to consider if the returned response may have diagnostic value.

## Location

`GetLocations` method.

## Code Issue

```go
_, err := client.Api.Execute(ctx, nil, "GET", apiUrl.String(), nil, nil, []int{http.StatusOK}, &locations)
```

## Fix

If the response value is not needed, name it `_` as is done now, or use documentation to explain, or optionally examine and return it for better caller observability.

```go
resp, err := client.API.Execute(ctx, nil, "GET", apiUrl.String(), nil, nil, []int{http.StatusOK}, &locations)
// Optionally use resp for additional validation or logging
return locations, err
```
