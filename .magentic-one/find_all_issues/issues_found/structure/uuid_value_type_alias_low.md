# Unnecessary Type Alias for UUID

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/customtypes/uuid_value.go

## Problem

The code defines

```go
type UUID = UUIDValue
```

This type alias appears unnecessary unless there is a specific reason in the codebase to prefer `UUID` as an alias for `UUIDValue`. This can reduce code clarity, as now two names exist for the same type without an obvious distinction between usage contexts. Type aliases can make code harder to search, refactor, and understand.

## Impact

**Low Severity**: Minor reduction in code clarity and maintainability.

## Location

Declaration of `UUID` as a type alias for `UUIDValue`.

## Code Issue

```go
type UUID = UUIDValue
```

## Fix

Remove the type alias unless there is an established need for it that is documented and justified in the codebase. All references to `UUID` can be changed to `UUIDValue` for consistency and clarity:

```go
// type UUID = UUIDValue // Remove this line
```
