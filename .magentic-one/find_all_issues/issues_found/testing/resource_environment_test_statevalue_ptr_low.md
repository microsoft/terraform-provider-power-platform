# Overuse of Pointers for Simple State Tracking (StateValue)

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/resource_environment_test.go

## Problem

In the test `TestAccEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Update_Environment_Type`, the pattern uses `var environmentIdStep1 = &mocks.StateValue{}` (pointer allocation for a simple value holder) and later passes pointers around just to compare values. Given Go's typical best practices, this is unnecessary overhead for tests where values could be stored inline as variables (using string or custom type, not pointers to struct for simple comparison).

## Impact

- **Severity: Low**
- Minor complexity, pointer dereferencing for value comparison,
- Makes value tracking in tests a bit more cumbersome than necessary,
- Could mislead future readers into thinking that complex lifecycle or interface requirements are present, when really it's just primitive value holding.

## Location

```go
var environmentIdStep1 = &mocks.StateValue{}
var environmentIdStep2 = &mocks.StateValue{}
// Used with mocks.GetStateValue, etc.
```

## Code Issue

```go
var environmentIdStep1 = &mocks.StateValue{}
var environmentIdStep2 = &mocks.StateValue{}
// Used with statecheck.ExpectKnownValue, mocks.TestStateValueMatch, etc.
```

## Fix

Prefer using primitive types or struct values without pointers when all you need is value comparison or simple state passing. Example:

```go
var environmentIdStep1 string
var environmentIdStep2 string
// Set/get values directly, or use a lightweight helper wrapper that doesn't require pointer indirection.

// Use direct value assignment or helpers if a struct is required
// Example suggestion if API truly needs pointers:
environmentIdStep1 := mocks.StateValue{Value: "id1"}
environmentIdStep2 := mocks.StateValue{Value: "id2"}
// And pass as value, not as pointer if not strictly needed.
```

If the test API really needs pointers, consider refactoring the helper methods to use value receivers so simple value usage is possible.
