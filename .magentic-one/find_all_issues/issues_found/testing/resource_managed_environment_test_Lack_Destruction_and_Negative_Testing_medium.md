# Title

Lack of Edge Case and Negative Testing for Resource Destruction and Failures

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/resource_managed_environment_test.go

## Problem

The test file provides various acceptance and unit tests for resource creation and updates, as well as some negative testing (like invalid checker rules, missing Dataverse, etc.). However, it is missing coverage for important scenarios:

- Destruction/deletion testing: There are no `CheckDestroy` functions or steps to ensure resources are actually removed on delete.
- Resource re-creation after deletion: Edge cases where the resource is destroyed, and then recreated, are not addressed.
- Simulated API/server errors (e.g., API returns 500, 404, etc.) are not tested or asserted.
- Failure scenarios, like what happens if a POST returns an unexpected status, are not covered.

## Impact

Medium. Not having these tests impacts reliability and confidence in the provider, and could let bugs through related to improper resource cleanup, state handling, or error propagation.

## Location

N/A (This opportunity is missing throughout the file but should be included alongside existing resource.TestCase setups.)

## Code Issue

```go
// Example resource.TestCase -- missing CheckDestroy and negative/mock error handling:
resource.Test(t, resource.TestCase{
    ProtoV6ProviderFactories: mocks.TestAccProtoV6ProviderFactories,
    Steps: []resource.TestStep{
        // ...Steps...
    },
})
```

## Fix

Add `CheckDestroy` for resources and simulate API failures (using httpmock) to test robustness. Example changes:

```go
resource.Test(t, resource.TestCase{
    ProtoV6ProviderFactories: mocks.TestAccProtoV6ProviderFactories,
    CheckDestroy: func(s *terraform.State) error {
        // Attempt to look up the resource via API or mock, and return error if not properly destroyed
        // This function should be implemented to validate resource clean-up
        return nil
    },
    Steps: []resource.TestStep{
        // Normal create/update steps...

        // Add destroy step:
        {
            ResourceName:      "powerplatform_managed_environment.managed_development",
            ImportState:       true,
            ImportStateVerify: true,
        },
    },
})

// For API error scenarios (using httpmock):
httpmock.RegisterResponder("POST", "https://some.api/endpoint",
    func(req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
        // Simulate an error response
        return httpmock.NewStringResponse(http.StatusInternalServerError, "server error"), nil
    })
// Then, add a Step expecting an error regex or specific error string.
```
