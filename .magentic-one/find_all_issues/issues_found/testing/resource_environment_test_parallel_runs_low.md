# Tests Do Not Use t.Parallel for Isolated Parallel Execution

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/resource_environment_test.go

## Problem

None of the test functions declare `t.Parallel()` for parallelizable tests. Many test cases are strictly independent and could be run in parallel, especially those using `httpmock` isolation or which constitute acceptance tests against non-conflicting resources.

Go's testing package supports test parallelization via `t.Parallel()` which shortens feedback cycles and increases test throughput, particularly for large test suites.

## Impact

- **Severity: Low**
- Longer wall clock time for CI/testing runs than needed.
- Missed opportunity to shake out concurrency-related flakiness or global test state issues earlier (test pollution).

## Location

All test functions in the file, e.g.:

```go
func TestUnitEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Attribute_Validators(t *testing.T) {
    // missing t.Parallel()
    ...
}
```

## Code Issue

All test functions are serial by default:

```go
func TestAccEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Create(t *testing.T) {
    ...
}
```

## Fix

Add `t.Parallel()` at the start of every test function that has no global side effects and can safely run concurrently with others. Where possible, design tests and mock usage so parallel execution is the default and exceptions are rare.

```go
func TestUnitEnvironmentsResource_Validate_Attribute_Validators(t *testing.T) {
    t.Parallel()
    ...
}
```

Add documentation to clarify if/where some tests deliberately avoid parallelism due to shared global state.
