# Code Structure: No Test Coverage Indicated for Custom Plan Modifier

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/modifiers/requires_replace_string_from_non_empty_modifier.go

## Problem

The file provides an implementation of a custom Terraform plan modifier, but there is no indication of test coverage or related test files. Complex plan modification logic should be accompanied by thorough tests to ensure correct behavior, especially in edge cases.

## Impact

**Severity: Medium**

Lack of tests for plan modifier logic can lead to regressions or unnoticed bugs when changes are made in the future. This is particularly important for provider logic that impacts resource replacement and state management.

## Location

Full file.

## Code Issue

_No specific test code or reference to test file(s) present._

## Fix

Add Go test functions in a corresponding `_test.go` file, ensuring behavior is validated for:

- No replacement when the state is empty
- Replacement when the state is non-empty and plan differs
- No replacement if state is unknown or null
- Edge cases (e.g., whitespace, case sensitivity, etc.)

Example (in a new file):

```go
// requires_replace_string_from_non_empty_modifier_test.go

func TestRequireReplaceStringFromNonEmptyPlanModifier(t *testing.T) {
    // Example test to verify replacement logic
    // You would construct dummy requests and assert response fields are set as intended
}
```

This will ensure ongoing code quality and correctness for your custom modifier.
