# Title

No test coverage indications or testing hooks

##

internal/services/licensing/resource_billing_policy_environment.go

## Problem

The file does not contain any references to testing, test hooks, or integration with test frameworks. There are no build tags, comments, or function/variable exposures designed to facilitate unit or integration testing. With the current structure, direct testing of internal methods or edge cases (e.g., error handling, invalid input, API failures) could be difficult.

## Impact

Severity: medium

Without clear test integration, it is harder to ensure quality and correctness. Lack of direct testability impairs early detection of breaking changes and may lead to regressions in critical resource operations.

## Location

File-wide—there are no testing hooks or facilities for dependency injection/mock clients.

## Code Issue

_No explicit code sample; it's the absence of any testing/test hooks._

## Fix

Expose testable functions or enable dependency injection for the API client. Consider providing unit tests for the resource using Go’s built-in testing tools or the framework’s test facilities. Add a build tag or package-level comment indicating test integration, and refactor if necessary to facilitate mocking and edge-case testing.

```go
// Example: Allow dependency injection/mocking in tests
type BillingPolicyEnvironmentResource struct {
    LicensingClient LicensingClientInterface // now an interface
    // ...
}
// In production:
r.LicensingClient = NewLicensingClient(...)
// In tests:
r.LicensingClient = &MockLicensingClient{...}

// Add unit tests under *_test.go
```
