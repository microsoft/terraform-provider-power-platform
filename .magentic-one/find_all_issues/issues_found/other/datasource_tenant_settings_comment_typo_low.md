# Incorrect Terminology in Comment: 'null' Instead of 'nil'

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/tenant_settings/datasource_tenant_settings.go

## Problem

A comment states: `ProviderData will be null when Configure is called from ValidateConfig. It's ok.`

Go programs use the keyword `nil` for uninitialized pointers/interfaces, not `null`. Using the wrong term in comments can confuse new developers or those coming from JavaScript or other languages. Itâ€™s minor, but worth correcting for professionalism and accuracy.

## Impact

May confuse code readers. Slightly reduces professional polish and correctness of documentation/commentary. **Severity: Low**

## Location

At the top of the `Configure` method:
```go
// ProviderData will be null when Configure is called from ValidateConfig.  It's ok.
```

## Fix

Update the comment to use `nil`, the correct Go terminology:
```go
// ProviderData will be nil when Configure is called from ValidateConfig. It's ok.
```
