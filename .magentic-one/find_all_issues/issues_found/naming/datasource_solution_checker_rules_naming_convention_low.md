# Title

Inconsistent Naming Convention for Function and Field Names

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/solution_checker_rules/datasource_solution_checker_rules.go

## Problem

The code uses both `environment_id` and `EnvironmentId` for the same concept. The field in the struct likely follows Go's PascalCase for exported fields, but the schema attribute uses snake_case. Although this is a common convention in Terraform providers between Go structs and schema keys, clarity can be improved with explicit comments or documentation showing the mapping between schema attributes and internal struct fields.

## Impact

May lead to confusion for future maintainers, especially those new to writing Terraform providers in Go, due to inconsistent use of naming conventions. Severity is **low**, as this is unlikely to cause functional issues but could affect code readability and onboarding.

## Location

Schema attribute definition versus Go struct access:

```go
"environment_id": schema.StringAttribute{
    MarkdownDescription: "The ID of the environment to retrieve solution checker rules from",
    Required:            true,
},
...
environmentId := state.EnvironmentId.ValueString()
```

## Code Issue

```go
"environment_id": schema.StringAttribute{ ... }
...
environmentId := state.EnvironmentId.ValueString()
```

## Fix

Consider documenting struct tag mappings or using struct tags if mapping between resource data and internal representations differs in format. For this provider framework, comments may be sufficient to clarify intent:

```go
// This field maps to the `environment_id` Terraform schema attribute
EnvironmentId tfsdk.String `tfsdk:"environment_id"`
```

Or in the code, add:

```go
// Maps environment_id schema key to EnvironmentId struct field
```
