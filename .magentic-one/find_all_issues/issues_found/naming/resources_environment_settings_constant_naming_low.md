# Title

Naming: Constant Naming Does Not Follow Go Conventions

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_settings/resources_environment_settings.go

## Problem

The constant `SERVICE_TAGS_NAMES` is in all uppercase with underscores, which doesn't follow the Go naming convention where constants should use `CamelCase` (e.g., `ServiceTagsNames`). This makes the code inconsistent with other Go code and can hinder readability.

## Impact

Code inconsistency with Go's idiomatic style may make the code harder to read and maintain for Go developers. Severity: low.

## Location

```go
const SERVICE_TAGS_NAMES = "ApiManagement,AppConfiguration,AppService,ActionGroup,AppServiceManagement,ApplicationInsightsAvailability,AutonomousDevelopmentPlatform,AzureActiveDirectory,AzureAdvancedThreatProtection,AzureArcInfrastructure,AzureAttestation,AzureBackup,AzureBotService,AzureCognitiveSearch,AzureConnectors,AzureContainerRegistry,AzureCosmosDB,AzureDataExplorerManagement,AzureDataLake,AzureDatabricks,AzureDevOps,AzureDevSpaces,AzureDeviceUpdate,AzureDigitalTwins,AzureEventGrid,AzureHealthcareAPIs,AzureInformationProtection,AzureIoTHub,AzureKeyVault,AzureLoadTestingInstanceManagement,AzureMachineLearning,AzureMachineLearningInference,AzureManagedGrafana,AzureMonitorForSAP,AzureMonitor,AzureOpenDatasets,AzurePortal,AzureRemoteRendering,AzureResourceManager,AzureSecurityCenter,AzureSentinel,AzureSignalR,AzureSiteRecovery,AzureSphere,AzureSpringCloud,AzureStack,AzureTrafficManager,AzureUpdateDelivery,AzureWebPubSub,BatchNodeManagement,ChaosStudio,CognitiveServicesFrontend,CognitiveServicesManagement,ContainerAppsManagement,DataFactory,Dynamics365BusinessCentral,Dynamics365ForMarketingEmail,Dynamics365FraudProtection,EOPExternalPublishedIPs,EventHub,GatewayManager,Grafana,GuestAndHybridManagement,HDInsight,KustoAnalytics,LogicApps,M365ManagementActivityApi,M365ManagementActivityApiWebhook,Marketplace,MicrosoftAzureFluidRelay,MicrosoftCloudAppSecurity,MicrosoftContainerRegistry,MicrosoftDefenderForEndpoint,MicrosoftPurviewPolicyDistribution,OneDsCollector,PowerBI,PowerPlatformPlex,PowerQueryOnline,SCCservice,Scuba,SecurityCopilot,SerialConsole,ServiceBus,ServiceFabric,Sql,SqlManagement,Storage,StorageMover,StorageSyncService,VideoIndexer,WindowsAdminCenter,WindowsVirtualDesktop"
```

## Code Issue

```go
const SERVICE_TAGS_NAMES = "ApiManagement,AppConfiguration,AppService,ActionGroup,AppServiceManagement,ApplicationInsightsAvailability,..."
```

## Fix

Rename the constant using Go's CamelCase for increased readability:

```go
const ServiceTagsNames = "ApiManagement,AppConfiguration,AppService,ActionGroup,AppServiceManagement,ApplicationInsightsAvailability,..."
```
Apply this change wherever `SERVICE_TAGS_NAMES` is referenced.
