# Issue: Naming Convention for Field in Struct

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_groups/models.go

## Problem

The field `Id` in the `EnvironmentGroupResourceModel` struct does not follow Go naming conventions according to commonly accepted practices for acronyms and initialisms. In Go, initialisms and acronyms should be written in all caps, so `Id` should be `ID`.

## Impact

Low. The code will work as expected but does not adhere to Go naming conventions, which may cause minor confusion or inconsistencies throughout the codebase, especially when integrating with other packages or when using code generation tools.

## Location

```go
type EnvironmentGroupResourceModel struct {
	Id          types.String `tfsdk:"id"`
	DisplayName types.String `tfsdk:"display_name"`
	Description types.String `tfsdk:"description"`
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
	Id          types.String `tfsdk:"id"`
```

## Fix

Rename the field from `Id` to `ID` to adhere to Go's naming conventions for acronyms and initialisms.

```go
	ID          types.String `tfsdk:"id"`
```
