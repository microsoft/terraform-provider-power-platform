# Naming of `client` Type is Non-Descriptive

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/api_managed_environment.go

## Problem

The main struct is simply named `client`, and the constructor is named `newManagedEnvironmentClient`. Go best practices prefer concrete and descriptive type names, ideally exported if used outside the local package. The minimal name `client` is ambiguous, especially within a large codebase where many packages may define their own `client` types.

## Impact

- **Low severity**
- Reduces code readability and makes debugging/searching harder across the codebase.
- Increases the risk of name clashes and confusion in usages and logging.

## Location

```go
type client struct {
    Api               *api.Client
    environmentClient environment.Client
}
```

## Code Issue

As shown above.

## Fix

Rename to something more descriptive and potentially exported if used by other packages, e.g.:

```go
type ManagedEnvironmentClient struct {
    Api               *api.Client
    environmentClient environment.Client
}

func NewManagedEnvironmentClient(apiClient *api.Client) ManagedEnvironmentClient {
    return ManagedEnvironmentClient{
        Api:               apiClient,
        environmentClient: environment.NewEnvironmentClient(apiClient),
    }
}
```
