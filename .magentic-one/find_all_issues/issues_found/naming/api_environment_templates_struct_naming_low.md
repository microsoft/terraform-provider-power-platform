# Code Structure: Naming Consistency for Types

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_templates/api_environment_templates.go

## Problem

The receiver and type name `client` is lowercase, which is unconventional in Go for struct type names. Struct types should be exported (capitalized as `Client`) if they are intended to be used outside the package, or should have a more descriptive unexported name if intended to be private. The variable and receiver names also being `client` can create confusion.

## Impact

Reduces code clarity, and increases the chance of confusion about the type vs. value usage. Severity: **Low**.

## Location

```go
type client struct {
	Api *api.Client
}

func (client *client) GetEnvironmentTemplatesByLocation(...)
```

## Code Issue

```go
type client struct {
	Api *api.Client
}

func (client *client) GetEnvironmentTemplatesByLocation(...)
```

## Fix

Rename the struct to `Client` if it is used externally, and use a shorter receiver name (e.g., `c`):

```go
type Client struct {
	Api *api.Client
}

func (c *Client) GetEnvironmentTemplatesByLocation(...)
```
