# Title

Incorrect Interface Name for the Environment Settings Client Field

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_settings/models.go

## Problem

In the `EnvironmentSettingsDataSource` and `EnvironmentSettingsResource` struct definitions, the struct tags use different interface/struct names for the client field: `EnvironmentSettingsClient` and `EnvironmentSettingClient` (missing 's'), which likely leads to a typo and logical error if the interfaces are not both defined and consistent.

## Impact

This inconsistency will cause compile-time errors if `client` variable or interface is not defined with both names, and can lead to confusion or bugs if the wrong client is injected. This is a medium-severity issue due to reliability and maintenance impacts.

## Location

Lines:

```go
type EnvironmentSettingsDataSource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	EnvironmentSettingsClient client
}

type EnvironmentSettingsResource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	EnvironmentSettingClient client
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
type EnvironmentSettingsDataSource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	EnvironmentSettingsClient client
}

type EnvironmentSettingsResource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	EnvironmentSettingClient client
}
```

## Fix

Ensure that both structs use the same, correct interface/type for the client field. For example, if the type should be `EnvironmentSettingsClient`, update both definitions as such:

```go
type EnvironmentSettingsDataSource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	EnvironmentSettingsClient client
}

type EnvironmentSettingsResource struct {
	helpers.TypeInfo
	EnvironmentSettingsClient client
}
```

This change makes the naming consistent and less error-prone. If the missing 's' is intentional, clarify it in documentation or comments for future maintainers.
