# Title

Inconsistent Receiver Naming: Use of 'client' Instead of Conventional 'c'

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/connection/api_connection.go

## Problem

The receiver for methods on the `client` struct is named `client`, which could potentially cause confusion between the type and the receiver instance. The Go convention recommends using a short, lowercased form such as `c` for method receivers.

## Impact

This can lead to readability issues and subtle bugs if local variables or types have similar names, making the code harder to understand and maintain. Severity: Low.

## Location

Every method receiver in this file, e.g.,

```go
func (client *client) GetConnections(ctx context.Context, environmentId string) ([]connectionDto, error)
```

## Code Issue

```go
func (client *client) GetConnections(ctx context.Context, environmentId string) ([]connectionDto, error)
```

## Fix

Change the receiver name from `client` to `c` for all methods in this file.

```go
func (c *client) GetConnections(ctx context.Context, environmentId string) ([]connectionDto, error)
```

This improves readability and follows Go idioms.
