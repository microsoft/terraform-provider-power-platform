# Typo in Type Name

## /workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/dto.go

## Problem

There is a typo in the struct name `EnviromentPropertiesDto`, which should be spelled `EnvironmentPropertiesDto`. This typo is not only non-idiomatic, it can increase confusion and technical debt by spreading inconsistent spelling throughout the codebase. The misspelling also appears in field types where this struct is used.

## Impact

This issue impacts code readability and maintainability. Developers may encounter issues when searching for environment-related code, and it can propagate errors as the typo is likely to be copy-pasted elsewhere. Severity: **low** (but can easily snowball).

## Location

- Type declaration around line 34
- Usage in `EnvironmentDto` struct

## Code Issue

```go
type EnviromentPropertiesDto struct { // typo here
    // ...
}

Properties *EnviromentPropertiesDto `json:"properties"` // typo in field type
```

## Fix

Correct the spelling of the struct name everywhere it's used, and update the references in the codebase.

```go
type EnvironmentPropertiesDto struct {
    // ...
}

Properties *EnvironmentPropertiesDto `json:"properties"`
```

Make sure to update any imports or references throughout your project to use the corrected name.
