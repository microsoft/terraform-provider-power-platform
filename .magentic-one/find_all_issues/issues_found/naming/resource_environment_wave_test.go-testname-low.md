# Test naming does not sufficiently describe scenario outcome

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_wave/resource_environment_wave_test.go

## Problem

Some test functions, such as `TestUnitEnvironmentWaveResource_Error`, do not clearly communicate what kind of error or specific scenario is being exercised. The word "Error" is too generic. More descriptive names such as `TestUnitEnvironmentWaveResource_FailedFeatureState` or `TestUnitEnvironmentWaveResource_APIReturnsFailed` would better convey intent. This makes it harder for maintainers or newcomers to quickly understand the purpose of each unit test and the conditions being simulated.

## Impact

Low. This only impacts readability, maintainability, and onboardingâ€”test discovery becomes harder as the suite grows.

## Location

```go
func TestUnitEnvironmentWaveResource_Error(t *testing.T) {
	// ...
}
```

## Fix

Rename functions to describe what specific error scenario is being exercised:

```go
func TestUnitEnvironmentWaveResource_FailedFeatureState(t *testing.T) {
	// ...
}
```

Adopt similar strategies for other test case functions as needed for clarity.
