# Title

Ambiguous Usage of `*[]AnalyticsDataDto` as Return Type in GetAnalyticsDataExport

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/analytics_data_export/api_analytics_data_exports.go

## Problem

The function `GetAnalyticsDataExport` returns a `*[]AnalyticsDataDto` (pointer to a slice), which is not idiomatic Go. Slices are already reference types and returning a pointer to a slice rarely provides benefit. This usage can introduce confusion and potential misuse.

## Impact

The code is less idiomatic and could create confusion about ownership, mutability, and nilness. Returning a pointer to a slice may also increase the risk of bugs and makes client code harder to reason about. Severity: Medium.

## Location

```go
func (client *Client) GetAnalyticsDataExport(ctx context.Context) (*[]AnalyticsDataDto, error)
```

## Code Issue

```go
func (client *Client) GetAnalyticsDataExport(ctx context.Context) (*[]AnalyticsDataDto, error)
```

And:

```go
return &adr.Value, nil
```

## Fix

Return a plain slice type:

```go
func (client *Client) GetAnalyticsDataExport(ctx context.Context) ([]AnalyticsDataDto, error) {
    ...
    return adr.Value, nil
}
```

Update all usages accordingly.
