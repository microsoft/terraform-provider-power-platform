# Title

Potential resource drift or confusion with pointer model usage in Create/Update

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment_group_rule_set/resource_environment_group_rule_set.go

## Problem

In `Create` and `Update` functions, the code retrieves the plan or state into a pointer (`*environmentGroupRuleSetResourceModel`), but when setting resource state, it passes the pointer directly to `resp.State.Set`, which expects the concrete value, not a pointer. Some utilities will automatically dereference, but this may lead to subtle bugs or errors in diagnostics, especially if the plan is not fully valid at this point.

## Impact

Medium.

- May result in incorrect behavior such as state not being stored properly or resource model being misrepresented.

## Location

```go
resp.Diagnostics.Append(req.Plan.Get(ctx, &plan)...)
//...
resp.Diagnostics.Append(resp.State.Set(ctx, &plan)...)
```

## Fix

Dereference the pointer (once non-nil) when passing to `Set`:

```go
resp.Diagnostics.Append(resp.State.Set(ctx, plan)...)
```
or (for `plan` as pointer):

```go
if plan != nil {
    resp.Diagnostics.Append(resp.State.Set(ctx, *plan)...)
}
```

This may also clarify error messages and resource state behavior.
