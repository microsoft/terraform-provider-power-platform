# Uninitialized `environmentClient` Not Checked Everywhere

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/api_managed_environment.go

## Problem

The method `FetchSolutionCheckerRules` uses a comparison to check if the `environmentClient` is uninitialized:

```go
if client.environmentClient == (environment.Client{}) {
    return nil, errors.New("environmentClient is not initialized")
}
```

This is only present in `FetchSolutionCheckerRules`. The constructor (`newManagedEnvironmentClient`) always initializes this field, but should this client ever be created via a different method, usage of `environmentClient` in other methods could result in panics or nil pointer dereference. Moreover, relying on a struct value comparison to determine initialization is not idiomatic Go practice, especially as the zero value for a struct can be ambiguous (for instance, if the struct ever gains pointer or interface fields).

## Impact

If the instantiation logic changes in the future or a new constructor is introduced, missing or improperly initialized `environmentClient` could cause runtime errors. This is **medium severity**.

## Location

- `FetchSolutionCheckerRules`
- Type `client`
- Initialization at construction

## Code Issue

```go
if client.environmentClient == (environment.Client{}) {
    return nil, errors.New("environmentClient is not initialized")
}
```

## Fix

Make the intent clear and eliminate reliance on struct zero value for checks. Many Go APIs instead make `environmentClient` a pointer and check for nil. Example:

```go
type client struct {
    Api               *api.Client
    environmentClient *environment.Client // pointer!
}

// in constructor:
environmentClient: environment.NewEnvironmentClient(apiClient), // as pointer

// in use:
if client.environmentClient == nil {
    return nil, errors.New("environmentClient is not initialized")
}
```

This change clarifies client initialization and avoids pitfalls of struct zero value comparison.
