# Title

Improper error propagation after diagnostics append in Get plan/state

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/managed_environment/resource_managed_environment.go

## Problem

When reading Plan or State (e.g., in Create, Update, Delete, and Read), the code appends possible diagnostics from req.Plan.Get or req.State.Get, **but does not always immediately return** if there are errors. In Go TF providers, after appending diagnostics from a get operation, if an error is present then execution should cease since subsequent logic might use nil or partial values.

In the current code, some methods follow up diagnostics.HasError() with an immediate return (correct), but others may not do so consistently, risking logic continuation on error. This can occasionally result in panics (when dereferencing nil), or in subtle propagation of invalid resource state.

## Impact

Medium. Could cause panics or subtle state inconsistencies if not all code paths return immediately (`return`) when errors are present in diagnostics after state/plan get.

## Location

Affects all locations like:

## Code Issue

```go
resp.Diagnostics.Append(req.State.Get(ctx, &state)...)
if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
    return
}
```

## Fix

Ensure this pattern is present consistently after every `req.State.Get` or `req.Plan.Get` call throughout the resource:

```go
resp.Diagnostics.Append(req.State.Get(ctx, &state)...)
if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
    return
}
```

Audit to ensure every pathway after a `.Get()` checks for error and returns immediately.
