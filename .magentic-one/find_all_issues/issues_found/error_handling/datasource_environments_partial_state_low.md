# Possible Return of Partially Created State on Conversion Error

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/datasource_environments.go

## Problem

In the `Read` method, if an error is encountered in `convertSourceModelFromEnvironmentDto` for a specific environment, the function logs an error and returns immediately. However, since the function appends each converted environment to `state.Environments` inside the loop, a partially filled slice (containing only the successful conversions until the error) will be left in `state.Environments`. This could result in an ambiguous or partial state being persisted/used downstream if the `Set` operation is called before error return or if diagnostics do not interrupt subsequent processing.

## Impact

Might result in partially populated state visible to downstream processing (low severity for most scenarios, but could impact environments expecting all-or-nothing). **Severity: Low**.

## Location

```go
for _, env := range envs {
    ...
    env, err := convertSourceModelFromEnvironmentDto(...)
    if err != nil {
        resp.Diagnostics.AddError(fmt.Sprintf("Error when converting environment %s", env.DisplayName), err.Error())
        return
    }
    state.Environments = append(state.Environments, *env)
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
for _, env := range envs {
    ...
    env, err := convertSourceModelFromEnvironmentDto(...)
    if err != nil {
        resp.Diagnostics.AddError(fmt.Sprintf("Error when converting environment %s", env.DisplayName), err.Error())
        return
    }
    state.Environments = append(state.Environments, *env)
}
```

## Fix

Reset (nil or empty) `state.Environments` before returning on error, or avoid setting the state at all if a partial result was built before failure:

```go
for _, env := range envs {
    ...
    converted, err := convertSourceModelFromEnvironmentDto(...)
    if err != nil {
        state.Environments = nil // Or: = state.Environments[:0]
        resp.Diagnostics.AddError(fmt.Sprintf("Error when converting environment %s", env.DisplayName), err.Error())
        return
    }
    state.Environments = append(state.Environments, *converted)
}
```

This version ensures that if an error is encountered, no partial list is left in state, preserving an all-or-nothing update strategy and preventing ambiguity.
