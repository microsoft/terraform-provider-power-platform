# Issue 2: Error Not Propagated After Logging

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/application/api_application.go

## Problem

When parsing the `operationLocationHeader` fails, the error is only logged but not returned or handled, so the loop proceeds with an invalid URL that could lead to further errors or confusion.

## Impact

This issue has a **medium** severity. Failing to handle or propagate parse errors could result in attempts to make HTTP requests to an invalid URL, leading to confusing errors and wasted resources.

## Location

Within `InstallApplicationInEnvironment`:

## Code Issue

```go
_, err = url.Parse(operationLocationHeader)
if err != nil {
    tflog.Error(ctx, "Error parsing location header: "+err.Error())
}
```

## Fix

Return the error immediately after logging it, stopping further execution with an invalid URL:

```go
_, err = url.Parse(operationLocationHeader)
if err != nil {
    tflog.Error(ctx, "Error parsing location header: "+err.Error())
    return "", err
}
```
