# Issue: Redundant error checking in recursive error-handling branches

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/environment/api_environment.go

## Problem

Several methods in this file recursively call themselves in error-handling branches (e.g., on HTTP 409/Conflict), but may not always preserve the original stack trace or diagnostics context. Furthermore, the recursion is performed even if the error is not recoverable or could result in an infinite loop if the API repeatedly returns the same error.

## Impact

- Severity: Medium
- Can create the risk of infinite retry loops in pathological cases (API/Service bug or throttling).
- Makes debugging and observing error context more difficult.
- Decreases maintainability by duplicating error retry logic.

## Location

Example from `DeleteEnvironment` and similar in other methods:

```go
if response.HttpResponse.StatusCode == http.StatusConflict {
    err := client.handleHttpConflict(ctx, response)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return client.DeleteEnvironment(ctx, environmentId)
}
```

Similar patterns are in `CreateEnvironment`, `UpdateEnvironment`, and `UpdateEnvironmentAiFeatures` methods.

## Code Issue

```go
if response.HttpResponse.StatusCode == http.StatusConflict {
    err := client.handleHttpConflict(ctx, response)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return client.DeleteEnvironment(ctx, environmentId)
}
```

## Fix

Add some form of retry limit (e.g., maximum number of tries or a time budget) or utilize a proper exponential backoff/retry library. Consider returning an error if a conflict persists after several retries, to avoid infinite loops.

Pseudo-code example with a retry limit:

```go
const maxRetries = 5
func (client *Client) DeleteEnvironment(ctx context.Context, environmentId string, retryCount int) error {
    // ...
    if response.HttpResponse.StatusCode == http.StatusConflict {
        if retryCount >= maxRetries {
            return fmt.Errorf("maximum retries reached for DeleteEnvironment on conflict")
        }
        err := client.handleHttpConflict(ctx, response)
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        return client.DeleteEnvironment(ctx, environmentId, retryCount+1)
    }
    // ...
}
```

Alternatively, use a for-loop with a retry budget instead of recursion, and propagate retry state cleanly.
