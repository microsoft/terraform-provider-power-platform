# Title

Error handling: Possible Resource Leak if httpmock.DeactivateAndReset is Not Run

##

/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/internal/services/copilot_studio_application_insights/resource_copilot_studio_application_insights_test.go

## Problem

`httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()` is deferred immediately after `httpmock.Activate()` in the test functions. If for some reason `Activate()` fails (e.g. panics, though unlikely in this context), this may lead to inconsistent test state in future testsâ€”especially since the provider testing framework sometimes executes tests in parallel or in unpredictable order. Additionally, resource cleanup is not mentioned for other mocks or global state changes.

## Impact

Medium severity. While this is a rare occurrence, improper cleanup in tests might lead to flakiness or cross-test contamination, especially as the suite grows or parallelization is enabled.

## Location

Unit test functions activating/deactivating httpmock, such as:

```go
func TestUnitCopilotStudioApplicationInsights_Validate_Create(t *testing.T) {
	httpmock.Activate()
	defer httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
	...
}
```

and

```go
func TestUnitCopilotStudioApplicationInsights_Validate_Update(t *testing.T) {
	httpmock.Activate()
	defer httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
	...
}
```

## Code Issue

```go
httpmock.Activate()
defer httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
```

## Fix

Consider using subtests (`t.Run`) to scope setup/teardown, or use `t.Cleanup` (Go 1.14+) for better integration with the test runner. This ensures cleanup runs only if activation is successful and properly tracks nested test state.

```go
if err := httpmock.Activate(); err != nil {
    t.Fatalf("failed to activate httpmock: %v", err)
}
t.Cleanup(func() {
    httpmock.DeactivateAndReset()
})
```
