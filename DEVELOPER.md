# Developer Guide

The Terraform Provider for Power Platform extends Terraform's capabilities to allow Terraform to manage Power Platform infrastructure and services.  The provider is built on the modern [Terraform Plugin Framework](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework) and NOT on the the older Terraform SDK.  Ensure that you are referencing the correct [Plugin Framework documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework) when developing for this provider.

If you want to contribute to the provider, refer to the [Contributing Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) which can help you learn about the different types of contributions you can make to the repo.  The following documentation will help developers get setup and prepared to make code contributions to the repo.

## Devcontainer

If you want to contribute to this project, you can use the devcontainer feature in Visual Studio Code to create a consistent and isolated development environment. A devcontainer is a Docker container that has all the tools and dependencies needed to work with the codebase. You can open any folder inside the container and use VS Code’s full feature set, including IntelliSense, code navigation, debugging, and extensions.

## Developer Requirements

To use the devcontainer in this repo, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed in VS Code.

## Opening the Devcontainer

Once you have the prerequisites, you can follow these steps to open the repo in a devcontainer:

1. Clone or fork this repo to your local machine.
1. Open VS Code and press F1 to open the command palette. Type “Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container…” and select it.
1. Browse to the folder where you cloned or forked the repo and click “Open”.
1. VS Code will reload and start building the devcontainer image. This may take a few minutes depending on your network speed and the size of the image.
1. When the devcontainer is ready, you will see “Dev Container: Power Platform Terraform Provider Development” in the lower left corner of the VS Code status bar. You can also open a new terminal (Ctrl+Shift+`) and see that you are inside the container.
1. You can now edit, run, debug, and test the code as if you were on your local machine. Any changes you make will be reflected in the container and in your local file system.

Note: To work with the repository you will need to verify or configure your GIT credentials, you can do it as follows in the dev Container terminal:

- Verify Git user name and email:

```bash
git config --list
```

You should see your username and email listed, if they do not appear or you want to change them you must
establish them following the step below, (to quit the "git config" mode type "q").

- Change or set your Git username and email in the Dev Container:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@address"
```

Note: if you logging to docker container's shell outside the VS Code, in order to work with git repository, run the following commands:

```bash
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(ls -t /tmp/vscode-ssh-auth* | head -1)
export REMOTE_CONTAINERS_IPC=$(ls -t /tmp/vscode-remote-containers-ipc* | head -1)
```

For more information about devcontainers, you can check out the [devcontainer documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) and [sharing Git credentials with your container](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/sharing-git-credentials).

## Power Platform Prerequisites

### Tenant

Developers should have access to a tenant where they can create and delete Power Platform environments and other resources and run acceptance test.
You can setup access to you tenant using the following [bootstrap readme](https://github.com/microsoft/power-platform-terraform-quickstarts/blob/main/bootstrap/README.md) from our quickstarts repository.

### Credentials

See the [provider's user documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/terraform-provider-power-platform#authentication) on authenticating to the provider once your tenant is set up.

### Environment Variables

Use environment variables to configure the provider to use your chosen credentials.  You may either pass credentials as terraform variables (via `TF_VAR_*` environment variables) or by using the provider's own environment variables (`POWER_PLATFORM_*`).  See the [provider's user documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/terraform-provider-power-platform#authentication) for more information on configuring credentials for the provider.

## Running Provider locally in VSCode

Open bash terminal inside VSCode and execute the following commands:

```bash
# you should already be in this directory, but just in case
cd /workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform

# Build and install the provider's binary locally
make install

# Navigate to a folder that contains *.tf files and run below
cd examples/data-sources/powerplatform_environments

# Run terraform to validate that provider is functioning
terraform plan
```

If you prefer to use you operating system terminal instead of VSCode you can run the following command:

```bash
docker exec -u vscode -w /workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform -it <your_docker_container_name_goes_here> bash -c "exec bash"
```

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot run `terraform init` when using dev overrides. `terraform init` will validate the versions and provider source, while `terraform plan` will skip those validations when `dev overrides` is part of your config. You can simply run `terraforn plan` and `terrafirn apply` when working in devcontainer.

> [!TIP]
> Because when working locally the `terraform init` command will not work, if you need additional terraform providers from terraform registry, all of them have to be added locally to the devcontainer in order to `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` work. You can add you missing terraform providers by adding them `.devcontainer/features/acceptance_test_dependencies/main.tf` and rebuild the devcontainer.

## Debugging provider in VSCode

1. Open VSCode with the root folder as the parent of this ReadMe
1. Click On Run and Debug (F5)
1. Copy `TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS` value in the Debug Console
1. Run `export TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS=<value>` with the value copied from the above step
1. Add breakpoints
1. `cd` to a parent folder where main.tf exists
1. Run `terraform apply`

## Running Acceptance Tests

To run all acceptance tests

```bash
make acctest
```

To run single acceptance test

```bash
TF_ACC=1 go test -v ./... -run TestAcc<test_name>
```

## Running Unit Tests

To run all unit tests

```bash
make unittest
```

To run single unit test

```bash
TF_ACC=0 go test -v ./... -run TestUnit<test_name>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The tests require permissions on the folders, these permissions are assigned when creating your container. If you have permission problems when running the unit tests, you can rebuild your development container or run the following commands again to assign the permissions to the necessary folders.

```bash
sudo chown -R vscode /workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/
sudo chown -R vscode /go/pkg
```

## Writing Tests

All the test for a given resource/datasource are located in `/internal/powerplatform/<resource/datasource_name>_test.go` file. When writing a new feature you should try to create [happy path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path) test(s) for you feature covering create, read and deletion of your new feature. For updates you should cover not only update of all properties but situation when a force recreate of a resource is requried (if you have such propeties in you resource).

### Writing Unit Tests

Unit test are created by mocking HTTP request, some of the often used HTTP mocks encapsulated in `ActivateEnvironmentHttpMocks` function, so that you don't have to write them for every test. When implementing new mocks, the mokcked response json files should be located in `/internal/powerplatform/services/<your_service_name>/test/<resource_or_datasource>/<name_of_the_unit_test>` folder

> [!TIP]
> When creating mocked json responses you can resuse the exising one by **duplicating** then into you `<name_of_the_unit_test>` folder.

> [!CAUTION]
> Your mocked json response file should not contain any Personally Identifiable Information such as tenantid, usernames, phone numbers, emails, addresses etc. You should anonymize that data.

### Writing Acceptance Tests

Each acceptance test is a copy of an unit test from tested use case perspective. That means for a given unit test we should have an acceptance test that validates the same use case but against a real infrastructure.

## Adding Dependencies

This provider uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
Please see the Go documentation for the most up to date information about using Go modules.

To add a new dependency `github.com/author/dependency` to your Terraform provider:

```sh
go get github.com/author/dependency
make deps
```

## Updating Dependencies

Open a terminal in your devcontainer and type

```sh
make deps
```

## Updating Documentation

User documentation markdown files in [/docs](/docs/) are auto-generated by the [terraform plugin docs tool](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not manually edit the markdown files in [/docs](/docs/). If you need to edit documentation edit the following sources:

- schema information in the provider, resource, and data-source golang files that are in [/internal](/internal/)
- [template files](templates/)

```sh
make userdocs
```

User documentation is temporarily served on GitHub Pages which requires the [pages.yml GitHub workflow](/.github/workflows/pages.yml) to transform /docs markdown files into a static website.  Once this provider is published to the Terraform registry, documentation will be hosted on the registry instead.

## Making a Release

> [!TIP]
> In you development work flow, you don't have to release the provider in order to test it locally, instread you can use the devcontainer and keep installing it locally in there by using `make install` command.

Our releases use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Use the `preview` extension to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format for preview release such as `v0.7.0-preview`.

### Using the CLI

Use the `git tag` command on the `main` branch (ensure main is up to date) and then push that release back to origin.

``` bash
git tag -a v1.0.0-preview -m "v1.0.0-preview"
git push origin v1.0.0-preview
```

Once the release is pushed to the repo, the [release.yml](/.github/workflows/release.yml) action pipeline will detect the new tag and create a draft release. After the build completes, you can publish the release if it looks good.

## Developer work flow

Once you decide to contribute back to this reposity by fixing a bug or adding a feature you work flow will be as follows:

1. Fork this repository and open in locally
1. Start working in devcontainer on your changes. (commands: `make install`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`)
    - Completly new feature should be located in a new `/internal/powerplatform/services/<new_service_name>` folder.
1. Add and/or update unit and accaptance tests. Tests for new feature should be created in new resource/datasource_test.go file (commands: `make unittest`, `make acctest`)
    - When working on a bug remember to add a new unit and acceptance test(s) covering your use case if that test does not exist yet.
    - When working on a new feature add unit and acceptance tests covering [happy path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path) for your feature, ideally also some edge cases. If you feature enhances existing resource/datasource, add/change validation of your new properties in all tests that use that resource/datasource
1. Create/Update examples in `/examples/...` folder(s)
    - When working on enhacement remeber to add new enhacement properties to all existing examples using that resource/datasource, especially if it is a requried property.
    - When creating new resource/datasource, create new examples showcasing how to use it.
1. Regenerate the docs. (commands: `make docs`)
1. Raise a pull request from your fork back the this repository

> [!NOTE]
> If your use case requries testing outside local devcontainer like for example running it from a Github action, then you will need to create a realease from your fork repository.
