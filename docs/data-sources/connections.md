# powerplatform_connections (Data Source)

Fetches a list of [Connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/add-manage-connections) for a given environment. Each connection represents an connection instance to an external data source or service.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    powerplatform = {
      source = "microsoft/power-platform"
    }
  }
}

provider "powerplatform" {
  use_cli = true
}

data "powerplatform_environments" "all_environments" {}

data "powerplatform_connections" "all_connections" {
  environment_id = data.powerplatform_environments.all_environments.environments[0].id
}
```

Depending on required authentication parameters of a given connector, the connection parameters can vary.
- `connection_parameters_set` (String) Set of connection parameters. Json string containing the authentication connection parameters (if connection is interactive, leave blank), (for example)[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/desktop-flows/alm/alm-connection#create-a-connection-using-your-service-principal].
