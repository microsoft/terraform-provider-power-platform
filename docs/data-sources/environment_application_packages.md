# powerplatform_environment_application_packages (Data Source)

Fetches the list of Dynamics 365 applications in a tenant.  The data source can be filtered by name and publisher name.

This is functionally equivalent to the [Environment-level view of apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/manage-apps#environment-level-view-of-apps) in the Power Platform Admin Center or the [`pac application list` command from Power Platform CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/application#pac-application-list).  This data source uses the [Get Environment Application Package](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-platform/appmanagement/applications/get-environment-application-package) endpoint in the Power Platform API.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    powerplatform = {
      source = "microsoft/power-platform"
    }
  }
}

provider "powerplatform" {
  use_cli = true
}

data "powerplatform_environments" "all_environments" {}

data "powerplatform_environment_application_packages" "all_applications" {
  environment_id = data.powerplatform_environments.all_environments.environments[0].id
}

data "powerplatform_environment_application_packages" "all_applications_from_publisher" {
  environment_id = data.powerplatform_environments.all_environments.environments[0].id
  publisher_name = "Power Platform Host Service"
}

data "powerplatform_environment_application_packages" "specific_application" {
  environment_id = data.powerplatform_environments.all_environments.environments[0].id
  publisher_name = "Microsoft Dynamics 365"
  name           = "Virtual connectors in Dataverse"
}
```
