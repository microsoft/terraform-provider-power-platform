# powerplatform_environment_settings (Resource)

Manages Power Platform Settings for a given environment. They control various aspects of Power Platform features and behaviors, See [Environment Settings Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/admin-settings) for more details.  While this resource provides a limited set of settings, many of the settings in an environment are stored as Dataverse records and can be managed using `powerplatform_data_record` resource.  See the [data record resource documentation](./data_record) for examples of how to manage more environment settings like business units, roles, and more.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    powerplatform = {
      source = "microsoft/power-platform"
    }
  }
}

provider "powerplatform" {
  use_cli = true
}

resource "powerplatform_environment" "example_environment_settings" {
  display_name     = "example_environment_settings"
  location         = "europe"
  environment_type = "Sandbox"
  dataverse = {
    language_code     = "1033"
    currency_code     = "USD"
    security_group_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  }
}

resource "powerplatform_environment_settings" "settings" {
  environment_id = powerplatform_environment.example_environment_settings.id

  audit_and_logs = {
    plugin_trace_log_setting = "Exception"
    audit_settings = {
      is_audit_enabled             = true
      is_user_access_audit_enabled = true
      is_read_audit_enabled        = true
      log_retention_period_in_days = -1 //Forever
    }
  }
  email = {
    email_settings = {
      max_upload_file_size_in_bytes = 123456
    }
  }
  product = {
    behavior_settings = {
      show_dashboard_cards_in_expanded_state = true
    }
