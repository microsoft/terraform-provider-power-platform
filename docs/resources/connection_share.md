# powerplatform_connection_share (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform

  required_providers {
    powerplatform = {
      source = "microsoft/power-platform"
    }
  }
}

provider "powerplatform" {
  use_cli = true
}


resource "powerplatform_connection" "new_sql_connection" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id
  name           = "shared_sql"
  display_name   = "My SQL Connection"
  connection_parameters_set = jsonencode({
    "name" : "oauthSP",
    "values" : {
      "token" : {
        "value" : "https://global.consent.azure-apim.net/redirect/sql"
      },
      "token:TenantId" : {

      },
      "token:clientId" : {
        "value" : "${var.client_id}"
      },
      "token:clientSecret" : {
        "value" : "${var.client_secret}"
      }
    }
  })

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      connection_parameters_set
    ]
  }
}

resource "powerplatform_connection_share" "share_with_admin" {

## Schema

### Required

- `connection_id` (String) Unique identifier of the connection
- `connector_name` (String) Name of the connector
- `environment_id` (String) Unique identifier of the environment
- `principal` (Attributes) Principal to share the connection with (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--principal))
- `role_name` (String) Name of the role to assign to the principal

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the connection share

<a id="nestedatt--principal"></a>
### Nested Schema for `principal`

Required:

- `entra_object_id` (String) Entra Object Id of the principal

Read-Only:

- `display_name` (String) Display name of the principal


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
