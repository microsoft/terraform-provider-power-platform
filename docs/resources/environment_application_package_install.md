# powerplatform_environment_application_package_install (Resource)

This resource allows you to install a Dynamics 365 application in an environment. This is functionally equivalent to the 'Install' button in the Power Platform admin center or [`pac application install` in the Power Platform CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/data-platform/powerapps-cli#pac-application-install).  This resource uses the [Install Application Package](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-platform/appmanagement/applications/install-application-package) endpoint in the Power Platform API.


## Known Limitations

- This resource only supports the installation of applications. Once installed, the application will remain until the environment is deleted; updates or deletions are not supported.
- Not all applications are available in every region. Depending on the location of your `powerplatform_environment`, you may encounter the `Package requested for installation was not found` error if the application is not available in that region.
