# powerplatform_billing_policy_environment (Resource)

This resource allows you to manage the environments associated with a [billing policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/pay-as-you-go-overview#what-is-a-billing-policy). A billing policy is a set of rules that define how a tenant is billed for usage of Power Platform services. A billing policy is associated with a billing instrument, which is a subscription and resource group that is used to pay for usage of Power Platform services.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    powerplatform = {
      source = "microsoft/power-platform"
    }
    azurerm = {
      source = "hashicorp/azurerm"
    }
    azurecaf = {
      source = "aztfmod/azurecaf"
    }
  }
}

provider "powerplatform" {
  use_cli = true
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  use_cli = true
}

provider "azurecaf" {
}

data "azurerm_client_config" "current" {
}

resource "azurecaf_name" "rg_example_name" {
  name          = "power-platform-billing"
  resource_type = "azurerm_resource_group"
  random_length = 5
  clean_input   = true
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg_example" {
  name     = azurecaf_name.rg_example_name.result
  location = "westeurope"
}

resource "powerplatform_billing_policy" "pay_as_you_go" {
  name     = "payAsYouGoBillingPolicyExample"
  location = "europe"
  status   = "Enabled"
  billing_instrument = {
    resource_group  = azurerm_resource_group.rg_example.name
    subscription_id = data.azurerm_client_config.current.subscription_id
  }
}

resource "powerplatform_environment" "env1" {
  display_name     = "billing_policy_example_environment_1"
  location         = "europe"
  azure_region     = "northeurope"
  environment_type = "Sandbox"
}

resource "powerplatform_environment" "env2" {
  display_name     = "billing_policy_example_environment_2"
  location         = "europe"
  azure_region     = "northeurope"
  environment_type = "Sandbox"
}

resource "powerplatform_billing_policy_environment" "pay_as_you_go_policy_envs" {
  billing_policy_id = powerplatform_billing_policy.pay_as_you_go.id
  environments      = [powerplatform_environment.env1.id, powerplatform_environment.env2.id]
}
```

- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
