# powerplatform_data_record (Resource)

The Power Platform Data Record Resource allows the management of configuration records that are stored in Dataverse as records. This resource is not recommended for managing business data or other data that may be changed by Dataverse users in the context of normal business activities.

Data Record is a special type of a resources, that allows creation of any type Dataverese table record. The syntax for working with `data_record` resource is simmilar to raw WebAPI HTTP requests that this record uses:

## Example Usage

The following examples show how to use the `data_record` resource to configure some of the most common Dataverse settings.  These are minimal examples just to show the syntax, and do not include all possible configuration options.  Use these as a starting point if you need to set additional fields.

### Business Units

Example of how to create a [Business Unit](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-edit-business-units)

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    powerplatform = {
      source = "microsoft/power-platform"
    }
  }
}

variable "environment_id" {
  type = string
}

variable "name" {
  type = string
}

variable "costcenter" {
  type = string
}

variable "parent_business_unit_id" {
  type = string
}

resource "powerplatform_data_record" "business_unit" {
  environment_id     = var.environment_id
  table_logical_name = "businessunit"
  disable_on_destroy = true
  columns = {
    name       = var.name
    costcenter = var.costcenter
    parentbusinessunitid = {
      table_logical_name = "businessunit"
      data_record_id     = var.parent_business_unit_id
    }

## Schema

### Required

- `columns` (Dynamic) Columns of the data record table
- `environment_id` (String) Id of the Dynamics 365 environment
- `table_logical_name` (String) Logical name of the data record table

### Optional

- `disable_on_destroy` (Boolean) If true, the resource will either set isdisabled to true or statecode to 1 with a PATCH request, before attempting to delete the record.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique id (guid)

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
