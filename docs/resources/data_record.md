# powerplatform_data_record (Resource)

The Power Platform Data Record Resource allows the management of configuration records that are stored in Dataverse as records. This resource is not recommended for managing business data or other data that may be changed by Dataverse users in the context of normal business activities.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    powerplatform = {
      source = "microsoft/power-platform"
    }
  }
}

provider "powerplatform" {
  use_cli = true
}


resource "powerplatform_environment" "data_record_example_env" {
  display_name     = "powerplatform_data_record_example"
  location         = "europe"
  environment_type = "Sandbox"
  dataverse = {
    language_code     = "1033"
    currency_code     = "USD"
    security_group_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  }
}

data "powerplatform_data_records" "root_business_unit" {
  environment_id    = powerplatform_environment.data_record_example_env.id
  entity_collection = "businessunits"
  filter            = "parentbusinessunitid eq null"
  select            = ["name"]
}

resource "powerplatform_data_record" "role" {
  environment_id     = powerplatform_environment.data_record_example_env.id
  table_logical_name = "role"

  columns = {
    name = "my custom role"

    businessunitid = {
      table_logical_name = "businessunit"
      data_record_id     = data.powerplatform_data_records.root_business_unit.rows[0].businessunitid
    }
  }
}

resource "powerplatform_data_record" "team" {
  environment_id     = powerplatform_environment.data_record_example_env.id
  table_logical_name = "team"
  columns = {
    name        = "main team"
    description = "main team description"

    teamroles_association = [
      {
        table_logical_name = "role"
        data_record_id     = powerplatform_data_record.role.id
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `columns` (Dynamic) Columns of the data record table
- `environment_id` (String) Id of the Dynamics 365 environment
- `table_logical_name` (String) Logical name of the data record table

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique id (guid)

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
