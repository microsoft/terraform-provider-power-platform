# powerplatform_managed_environment (Resource)

Manages a [Managed Environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/managed-environment-overview) and associated settings. A Power Platform Managed Environment is a suite of premium capabilities that allows administrators to manage Power Platform at scale with more control, less effort, and more insights. Once an environment is managed, it unlocks additional features across the Power Platform

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    powerplatform = {
      source = "microsoft/power-platform"
    }
  }
}

provider "powerplatform" {
  use_cli = true
}

resource "powerplatform_environment" "development" {
  display_name     = "example_managed_environment"
  location         = "europe"
  environment_type = "Sandbox"
  dataverse = {
    language_code     = "1033"
    currency_code     = "USD"
    security_group_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  }
}

resource "powerplatform_managed_environment" "managed_development" {
  environment_id                  = powerplatform_environment.development.id
  is_usage_insights_disabled      = true
  is_group_sharing_disabled       = true
  limit_sharing_mode              = "ExcludeSharingToSecurityGroups"
  max_limit_user_sharing          = 10
  solution_checker_mode           = "Warn"
  suppress_validation_emails      = true
  solution_checker_rule_overrides = toset(["meta-remove-dup-reg", "meta-avoid-reg-no-attribute"])
  maker_onboarding_markdown       = "this is example markdown"
  maker_onboarding_url            = "https://www.microsoft.com"
