# powerplatform_managed_environment (Resource)

Manages a [Managed Environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/managed-environment-overview) and associated settings. A Power Platform Managed Environment is a suite of premium capabilities that allows administrators to manage Power Platform at scale with more control, less effort, and more insights. Once an environment is managed, it unlocks additional features across the Power Platform

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    powerplatform = {
      source = "microsoft/power-platform"
    }
  }
}

provider "powerplatform" {
  use_cli = true
}

resource "powerplatform_environment" "development" {
  display_name     = "example_managed_environment"
  location         = "europe"
  environment_type = "Sandbox"
  dataverse = {
    language_code     = "1033"
    currency_code     = "USD"
    security_group_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  }
}

resource "powerplatform_managed_environment" "managed_development" {
  environment_id                  = powerplatform_environment.development.id
  is_usage_insights_disabled      = true
  is_group_sharing_disabled       = true
  limit_sharing_mode              = "ExcludeSharingToSecurityGroups"
  max_limit_user_sharing          = 10
  solution_checker_mode           = "Warn"
  suppress_validation_emails      = true
  solution_checker_rule_overrides = toset(["meta-avoid-reg-no-attribute", "meta-avoid-reg-retrieve", "app-use-delayoutput-text-input"])
  maker_onboarding_markdown       = "this is example markdown"

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique managed environment settings id (guid)
- `protection_level` (String) Protection level

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
