# powerplatform_solution (Resource)

Resource for importing exporting solutions in Power Platform environments.  This is the equivalent of the [`pac solution import`](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/solution#pac-solution-import) command in the Power Platform CLI.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    powerplatform = {
      source = "microsoft/power-platform"
    }
    local = {
      version = "2.5.1"
      source  = "hashicorp/local"
    }
  }
}

provider "powerplatform" {
  use_cli = true
}

provider "local" {}

resource "local_file" "solution_settings_file" {
  filename = "${path.module}/solution_settings.json"
  content  = <<EOF
{
  "EnvironmentVariables": [
    {
      "SchemaName": "cra6e_SolutionVariableDataSource",
      "Value": "/sites/Shared%20Documents1"
    },
    {
      "SchemaName": "cra6e_SolutionVariableJson",
      "Value": "{ \"value\": 1234, \"text\": \"abc\" }"
    },
    {
      "SchemaName": "cra6e_SolutionVariableText",
      "Value": "${powerplatform_environment.environment.id}"
    }
  ],
  "ConnectionReferences": [
    {
      "LogicalName": "cra6e_ConnectionReferenceSharePoint",
      "ConnectionId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
      "ConnectorId": "/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/apis/shared_sharepointonline"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
}

resource "powerplatform_environment" "environment" {
  display_name     = "Solution Import Test 1"
  location         = "europe"
  environment_type = "Sandbox"
  dataverse = {
    language_code     = "1033"
    currency_code     = "USD"
    security_group_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  }
}

resource "powerplatform_solution" "solution" {
  environment_id = powerplatform_environment.environment.id
  solution_file  = "${path.module}/TerraformTestSolution_Complex_1_1_0_0.zip"
  settings_file  = local_file.solution_settings_file.filename
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) Id of the environment where the solution is imported
- `solution_file` (String) Path to the solution file

### Optional

- `settings_file` (String) Path to the settings file. The settings file uses the same format as pac cli. See https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/alm/conn-ref-env-variables-build-tools#deployment-settings-file for more details
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `display_name` (String) Display name of the solution
- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the solution
- `is_managed` (Boolean) Indicates whether the solution is managed or not
- `settings_file_checksum` (String) Checksum of the settings file
- `solution_file_checksum` (String) Checksum of the solution file
- `solution_version` (String) Version of the solution

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
