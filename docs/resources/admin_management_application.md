# powerplatform_admin_management_application (Resource)

This resource allows you to register a service principal as an administrator for Power Platform.

This resource implements the process documented here [Registering an admin management application](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powerplatform-api-create-service-principal). A service principal can't register itself—by design, the application must be registered by an administrator.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    powerplatform = {
      source = "microsoft/power-platform"
    }
    azuread = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azuread"
      version = "~>2.53"
    }
    azurecaf = {
      source = "aztfmod/azurecaf"
      version = "~>1.2"
    }
  }
}

provider "powerplatform" {
  use_cli = true
}

provider "azuread" {
  use_cli = true
}

resource "azuread_application_registration" "example_app" {
  display_name = "Power Platform Example Admin Management Application"
}

resource "azuread_service_principal" "example_sp" {
  client_id = azuread_application_registration.example_app.client_id
}

resource "powerplatform_admin_management_application" "example_registration" {
  id = azuread_application_registration.example_app.client_id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Client id for the service principal

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Already registered admin management applications can be imported using the client id of a service principal (replace with a real client id)
terraform import powerplatform_admin_management_application.example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```
