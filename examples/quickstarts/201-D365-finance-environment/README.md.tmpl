# D365 Finance Deployment (201 level)

This Terraform module aims to provide a template for automating and standardizing the deployment and management of D365 Finance environments. It utilizes the deployment model outlined at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/unified-experience/finance-operations-apps-overview .

## Prerequisites

- Service Principal or User Account with appropriate permissions
- A properly assigned D365 license (for example, a Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management license). For more information on the new license requirements, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/unified-experience/finance-operations-apps-overview#transition-from-an-environment-slot-purchasing-model-to-a-capacity-based-model .

```hcl

module "d365_finance_environment" {
  source            = "./modules/{{ .ModuleName }}"
}

```

## Detailed Behavior

### Power Platform Environment

This module creates a Power Platform environment using a combination of the parameters in the terraform files as well as the default settings specified by the 'templates' property.

### Dynamics 365 Finance Environment

This module creates a Dynamics 365 Finance development environment using the default settings specified by the 'templates' and 'template_metadata' properties.

## Limitations and Considerations

- Provisioning can take over an hour, so refrain from rerunning the same environment creation Terraform files more than hourly, as this will cause unexpected behavior.
- Be sure the relevant users are assigned the correct Dynamics 365 licenses, as this can cause unexpected errors.
