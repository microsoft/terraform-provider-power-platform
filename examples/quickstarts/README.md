# Quickstart Examples

This directory contains a number of quickstart examples that demonstrate how to use the Power Platform Terraform Provider.  Each example is a standalone Terraform configuration. Each example has its own README.md file that explains how to use the example.  The examples are intended to be real-world scenarios that show how to use the provider in combination with other providers like AzureRM to create a complete solution.
