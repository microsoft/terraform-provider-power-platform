# {{ .RenderedProviderName }} Provider

The Power Platform provider allows managing environments and other resources within [Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

**⚠️ WARNING:** This code is experimental and provided solely for evaluation purposes. It is **NOT** intended for production use and may contain bugs, incomplete features, or other issues. Use at your own risk, as it may undergo significant changes without notice, and no guarantees or support are provided. By using this code, you acknowledge and agree to these conditions. Consult the documentation or contact the maintainer if you have questions or concerns.

## Requirements

This provider requires **Terraform >= 0.12**.  For more information on provider installation and constraining provider versions, see the [Provider Requirements documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/requirements).

## Installation

**ℹ INFO:** This provider is not yet published to the Terraform registry, so it requires a local installation to use it at this time.

To use the provider you can download the binaries from [Releases](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/releases) to your local file system and configure Terraform to use your local mirror.  See the [Explicit Installation Method Configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#explicit-installation-method-configuration) for more information about using local binaries.

## Authentication

The provider allows authentication via service principal or user credentials. All sensitive information should be passed into Terraform using environment variables (don't put secrets in your tf files).

### Using a Service Principal (Preferred)

To access Power Platform APIs using a service principal, you need to register a new service principal application in your own Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant and then register that same application with Power Platform.

You can find more information on how to do this in the following articles:

- [Programmability and Extensibility - Authentication - Power Platform | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/programmability-authentication-v2)
- [PowerShell: Create a service principal - Power Platform | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powershell-create-service-principal).
