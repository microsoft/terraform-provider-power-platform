## Requirements

This provider requires **Terraform >= 0.12**.  For more information on provider installation and constraining provider versions, see the [Provider Requirements documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/requirements).

## Installation

To use this provider, add the following to your Terraform configuration:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    powerplatform = {
      source  = "microsoft/power-platform"
      version = "~> 3.1" # Replace with the latest version
    }
  }
}
```

See the official Terraform documentation for more information about [requiring providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/requirements).

## Authenticating to Power Platform

Terraform supports a number of different methods for authenticating to Power Platform.

* [Authenticating to Power Platform using the Azure CLI](#authenticating-to-power-platform-using-the-azure-cli)
* [Authenticating to Power Platform using a Service Principal and OpenID Connect (OIDC) GitHub and Azure DevOps](#authenticating-to-power-platform-using-a-service-principal-and-openid-connect-oidc-github-and-azure-devops)
* [Authenticating to Power Platform using a Service Principal and a Client Secret](#authenticating-to-power-platform-using-a-service-principal-and-a-client-secret)
* [Authenticating to Power Platform using a Managed Identity](#authenticating-to-power-platform-using-a-managed-identity)

We recommend using either a Service Principal when running Terraform non-interactively (such as when running Terraform in a CI server) - and authenticating using the Azure CLI when running Terraform locally.

Important Notes about Authenticating using the Azure CLI:

* Terraform only supports authenticating using the az CLI (and this must be available on your PATH) - authenticating using the older azure CLI or PowerShell Cmdlets are not supported.
* Authenticating via the Azure CLI is only supported when using a User Account. If you're using a Service Principal (for example via az login --service-principal) you should instead authenticate via the Service Principal directly (either using a Client Secret or OIDC).

### Authenticating to Power Platform using the Azure CLI

The Power Platform provider can use the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/) to authenticate to Power Platform services. If you have the Azure CLI installed, you can use it to log in to your Microsoft Entra Id account and the Power Platform provider will use the credentials from the Azure CLI.

#### Prerequisites

1. [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
1. [Create an app registration for the Power Platform Terraform Provider](guides/app_registration.md)
1. Login using the scope as the "expose API" you configured when creating the app registration

    ```bash
    az login --allow-no-subscriptions --scope api://powerplatform_provider_terraform/.default
    ```

    Configure the provider to use the Azure CLI with the following code:

    ```terraform
    provider "powerplatform" {
      use_cli = true
    }
    ```

### Authenticating to Power Platform using a Service Principal and OpenID Connect (OIDC) GitHub and Azure DevOps

The Power Platform provider can use a Service Principal with OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate to Power Platform services. By using [Microsoft Entra's workload identity federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation), your CI/CD pipelines in GitHub or Azure DevOps can access Power Platform resources without needing to manage secrets.

#### OpenID Connect (OIDC) Authentication Prerequisites for GitHub Actions

1. [Create an app registration for the Power Platform Terraform Provider](guides/app_registration.md)
1. Register the App Registration with the Power Platform. This task can be performed using [the provider itself](/resources/admin_management_application.md) or [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powershell-create-service-principal).
1. [Create a trust relationship between your CI/CD pipeline and the app registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp)
1. Configure the provider to use OIDC with the following code:

    ```terraform
    provider "powerplatform" {
      use_oidc = true
    }
    ```

1. Configure your GitHub Actions Permissions, To use OIDC authentication with GitHub Actions, you need to configure the `permissions` for the workflow. The `id-token` permission is required to allow GitHub to generate an OIDC token for the workflow.
The `contents` permission is required to allow the workflow to access the repository contents.

    ```yaml
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    ```

##### Additional Resources about OIDC and GitHub Actions:

* [OpenID Connect authentication with Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/architecture/auth-oidc)
* [Configuring OpenID Connect for GitHub and Microsoft Entra ID](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-azure)
* [Configuring OpenID Connect in cloud providers](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-cloud-providers)

#### Authenticating to Power Platform using a Azure DevOps Workload Identity Federation (OIDC)

The Power Platform provider can use [Azure DevOps Workload Identity Federation](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/introduction-to-azure-devops-workload-identity-federation-oidc-with-terraform/) with Azure DevOps pipelines to authenticate to Power Platform services.
Creation of the Service connection in Azure DevOps can be done automatically or manually using an existing APP. Below, we explain both methods.

*Note: For similar hands-off authentication in GitHub and Azure DevOps, the Power Platform Provider also supports the [OIDC authentication method](#authenticating-to-power-platform-using-a-service-principal-with-oidc).*

#### Create an app registration with workload identity federation (automatic)

1. Create an Azure Resource Manager Service Connection in Azure DevOps using the [Create an app registration with workload identity federation (automatic)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure?view=azure-devops#create-an-app-registration-with-workload-identity-federation-automatic). This will automatically create an App Registration with workload identity federation. Once created, you will need the Service Connection ID number that appears below the Service Connection name "ID:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX", you will also need the Azure "Application (client) ID" of the service connection that you just create.
1. Configure the [App Permissions](guides/app_registration.md).
1. Register the App Registration with the Power Platform. This task can be performed using [the provider itself](/resources/admin_management_application.md) or [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powershell-create-service-principal).
1. Configure your Azure DevOps pipeline to use the Service Connection you created in step 1. This is done by adding the following variables to your pipeline:

    ```yaml
    env:
      ARM_OIDC_REQUEST_TOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)
      SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)
      SYSTEM_OIDCREQUESTURI: $(System.OidcRequestUri)
      POWER_PLATFORM_OIDC_REQUEST_URI: $(System.OidcRequestUri)
      POWER_PLATFORM_OIDC_TOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)
    ```

1. Configure the provider to use Azure DevOps Workload Identity Federation. This authentication option also requires values to be set in the `ARM_OIDC_REQUEST_TOKEN` and `POWER_PLATFORM_AZDO_SERVICE_CONNECTION_ID` environment variables, which should be configured in the AzDO pipeline itself. Note that this example sets some of the required properties in the provider configuration, but the whole configuration could also be performed using just environment variables.

    ```terraform
    provider "powerplatform" {
      tenant_id = var.tenant_id
      client_id = var.client_id # The client ID for the Azure resource containing the federated credentials for Azure DevOps. Should be an App Registration or a Managed Identity.
      use_oidc = true
    }
    ```

*Note: To Create service connections in Azure DevOps, you need to have the role: "[Application Developer](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-developer)" permission in the project settings. If you don't have this permission, you will need to ask your Azure DevOps administrator to create the service connection for you.*

#### Create an app registration with workload identity federation for an existing App Registration or User-assigned managed identity (manual)

1. Create an [App Registration](guides/app_registration.md) or a [User-Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). This resource will be used to manage the identity federation with Azure DevOps.
1. Register the App Registration or Managed Identity with the Power Platform. This task can be performed using [the provider itself](/resources/admin_management_application.md) or [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powershell-create-service-principal).
1. [Complete the service connection configuration in Azure and Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/release/configure-workload-identity?view=azure-devops&tabs=managed-identity). Note that Azure DevOps may automatically generate the federated credential in Azure, depending on your permissions and Azure Subscription configuration.
1. Configure your Azure DevOps pipeline to use the Service Connection you created in step 1. This is done by adding the following variables to your pipeline:

    ```yaml
    env:
      ARM_OIDC_REQUEST_TOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)
      SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)
      SYSTEM_OIDCREQUESTURI: $(System.OidcRequestUri)
      POWER_PLATFORM_OIDC_REQUEST_URI: $(System.OidcRequestUri)
      POWER_PLATFORM_OIDC_TOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)
    ```

1. Configure the provider to use Azure DevOps Workload Identity Federation. This authentication option also requires values to be set in the ARM_OIDC_REQUEST_TOKEN and POWER_PLATFORM_AZDO_SERVICE_CONNECTION_ID environment variables, which should be configured in the AzDO pipeline itself. Note that this example sets some of the required properties in the provider configuration, but the whole configuration could also be performed using just environment variables.

    ```terraform
    provider "powerplatform" {
      tenant_id = var.tenant_id
      client_id = var.client_id # The client ID for the Azure resource containing the federated credentials for Azure DevOps. Should be an App Registration or a Managed Identity.
      use_oidc = true
    }
    ```


#### Configuring Terraform to use OIDC

Now that we have our federated credential for Entra App and ready to use, it's possible to configure Terraform in a few different ways.

**Note: If using the AzureRM Backend you may also need to configure OIDC there too, see the [documentation for the AzureRM Backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend/azurerm) for more information.**

##### Environment Variables

Whether using OIDC with a generic token, GitHub Action, or Azure DevOps Pipeline, you need these common environment variables shown in the examples below.

    ```sh
    export POWER_PLATFORM_CLIENT_ID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    export POWER_PLATFORM_TENANT_ID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    export POWER_PLATFORM_USE_OIDC="true"
    ```

    ```Powershell
    $env:POWER_PLATFORM_CLIENT_ID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    $env:POWER_PLATFORM_TENANT_ID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    $env:POWER_PLATFORM_USE_OIDC="true"
    ```

##### Generic OIDC token (Environment Variables)

The provider will use the `POWER_PLATFORM_OIDC_REQUEST_URI` and `POWER_PLATFORM_OIDC_TOKEN` environment variables to authenticate to Power Platform. These variables are set by the CI/CD system when using OIDC authentication.

#### Pipeline Example of using OIDC with Azure DevOps with the task `Azure-CLI@2`

Azure DevOps Pipeline snippet for using the Power Platform and Azure provider in an Azure DevOps pipeline. This example uses the [AzureCLI@2](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-cli-v2?view=azure-pipelines) task to use the Service Connection and run Terraform commands.
Is triggered on changes to the `main` branch and uses a self-hosted agent pool named `your-agent-pool-name`. The pipeline also sets up environment variables for authentication.

```yaml
# Terraform pipeline for Azure DevOps and Power Platform using task "AzureCLI@2"

trigger:
- main

pool: 
  name: "your-agent-pool-name"
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

variables:
- name: POWER_PLATFORM_CLIENT_ID
  value: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
- name: POWER_PLATFORM_TENANT_ID
  value: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
- name: SERVICE_CONNECTION_ID
  value: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
- name: ARM_CLIENT_ID
  value: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
- name: ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
  value: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
- name: ARM_TENANT_ID
  value: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX

steps:
- task: AzureCLI@2
  displayName: 'Run Terraform Init, Plan, Apply, and Destroy'
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: $(SERVICE_CONNECTION_ID)
    scriptType: bash
    scriptLocation: "inlineScript"
    inlineScript: |
      # export TF_VAR variables for Azure authentication this variables should be set in your terraform code
      export TF_VAR_arm_client_id=$ARM_CLIENT_ID
      export TF_VAR_arm_subscription_id=$ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
      export TF_VAR_arm_tenant_id=$ARM_TENANT_ID
      export ARM_ADO_PIPELINE_SERVICE_CONNECTION_ID=$SERVICE_CONNECTION_ID
      # export Power Platform variables for authentication
      export TF_VAR_power_platform_client_id=$POWER_PLATFORM_CLIENT_ID
      export TF_VAR_power_platform_tenant_id=$POWER_PLATFORM_TENANT_ID
      export POWER_PLATFORM_AZDO_SERVICE_CONNECTION_ID=$SERVICE_CONNECTION_ID

      # Terraform CLI installation and commands

  env:
    ARM_OIDC_REQUEST_TOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)
    SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)
    SYSTEM_OIDCREQUESTURI: $(System.OidcRequestUri)
    POWER_PLATFORM_OIDC_REQUEST_URI: $(System.OidcRequestUri)
    POWER_PLATFORM_OIDC_TOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)

```

*Note: The `System.AccessToken`and `System.OidcRequestUri`, variables are automatically set by Azure DevOps and does not need to be configured manually.*




### Authenticating to Power Platform using a Service Principal and a Client Secret

The Power Platform provider can use a Service Principal with Client Secret to authenticate to Power Platform services.

1. [Create an app registration for the Power Platform Terraform Provider](guides/app_registration.md)
1. [Register your app registration with Power Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powerplatform-api-create-service-principal#registering-an-admin-management-application)
1. Configure the provider to use a Service Principal with a Client Secret with either environment variables or using Terraform variables

### Authenticating to Power Platform using Service Principal and certificate

1. [Create an app registration for the Power Platform Terraform Provider](guides/app_registration.md)
1. [Register your app registration with Power Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powerplatform-api-create-service-principal#registering-an-admin-management-application)
1. Generate a certificate using openssl or other tools

    ```bash
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 365
    ```

1. Merge public and private part of the certificate files together

    Using linux shell

    ```bash
    cat *.pem > cert+key.pem
    ```

    Using Powershell

    ```powershell
    Get-Content .\cert.pem, .\key.pem | Set-Content cert+key.pem
    ```

1. Generate pkcs12 file

    ```bash
    openssl pkcs12 -export -out cert.pkcs12 -in cert+key.pem
    ```

1. Add public part of the certificate (`cert.pem` file) to the app registration
1. Store your key.pem and the password used to generate in a safe place
1. Configure the provider to use certificate with the following code:

    ```terraform
    provider "powerplatform" {
      client_id     = var.client_id
      tenant_id     = var.tenant_id
      client_certificate_file_path = "${path.cwd}/cert.pkcs12"
      client_certificate_password  = var.cert_pass
    }
    ```

### Authenticating to Power Platform Using a Managed Identity

The Power Platform provider can use a [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) (previously called Managed Service Identity, or MSI) to authenticate to Power Platform services for keyless authentication in scenarios where the provider is being executed in select Azure services, such as Microsoft-hosted or self-hosted Azure DevOps pipelines.

#### System-Managed Identity

1. [Enable system-managed identity on an Azure resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)
1. Register the managed identity with the Power Platform using the Application ID from the enterprise application for the system-managed identity resource. This task can be performed using either [the Power Platform Terraform Provider itself](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/power-platform/latest/docs/resources/admin_management_application), or [PowerShell]([Register the managed identity with the Power Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powershell-create-service-principal).
1. Configure the provider to use the system-managed identity. Note that no Client ID is required as the Client ID is derived from the Azure resource running the provider.

    ```terraform
    provider "powerplatform" {
      use_msi = true
    }
    ```

#### User-Managed Identity

1. [Create a User-Managed Identity resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)
1. Register the managed identity with the Power Platform using the Application ID from the enterprise application for the system-managed identity resource. This task can be performed using either [the Power Platform Terraform Provider itself](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/power-platform/latest/docs/resources/admin_management_application), or [PowerShell]([Register the managed identity with the Power Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powershell-create-service-principal).
1. Configure the provider to use the System-Managed Identity. Note that this example sets the Client ID in the provider configuration, but it could also be set using the POWER_PLATFORM_CLIENT_ID environment variable.

    ```terraform
    provider "powerplatform" {
      use_msi = true
      client_id = var.client_id # This should be the Client ID from the user-managed identity resource.
    }
    ```

### Using Environment Variables

We recommend using Environment Variables to pass the credentials to the provider.

| Name | Description | Default Value |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `POWER_PLATFORM_CLIENT_ID` | The service principal client id | |
| `POWER_PLATFORM_CLIENT_SECRET` | The service principal secret | |
| `POWER_PLATFORM_TENANT_ID` | The guid of the tenant | |
| `POWER_PLATFORM_CLOUD` | override for the cloud used (default is `public`) | |
| `POWER_PLATFORM_USE_OIDC` | if set to `true` then OIDC authentication will be used | |
| `POWER_PLATFORM_USE_CLI` | if set to `true` then Azure CLI authentication will be used | |
| `POWER_PLATFORM_USE_MSI` | if set to `true` then Managed Identity authentication will be used | |
| `POWER_PLATFORM_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE` | The Base64 format of your certificate that will be used for certificate-based authentication | |
| `POWER_PLATFORM_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_FILE_PATH` | The path to the certificate that will be used for certificate-based authentication | |
| `POWER_PLATFORM_AZDO_SERVICE_CONNECTION_ID` | The GUID of the Azure DevOps service connection to be used for Azure DevOps Workload Identity Federation | |

-> Variables passed into the provider will override the environment variables.

#### Using Terraform Variables

Alternatively, you can configure the provider using variables in your Terraform configuration which can be passed in via [command line parameters](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#variables-on-the-command-line), [a `*.tfvars` file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#variable-definitions-tfvars-files), or [environment variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#environment-variables).  If you choose to use variables, please be sure to [protect sensitive input variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/sensitive-variables) so that you do not expose your credentials in your Terraform configuration.

```terraform
provider "powerplatform" {
  # Use a service principal to authenticate with the Power Platform service
  client_id     = var.client_id
  client_secret = var.client_secret
  tenant_id     = var.tenant_id
}
```

## Additional configuration

In addition to the authentication options, the following options are also supported in the provider block:

| Name | Description | Default Value |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `telemetry_optout` | Opting out of telemetry will remove the User-Agent and session id headers from the requests made to the Power Platform service.  There is no other telemetry data collected by the provider.  This may affect the ability to identify and troubleshoot issues with the provider. | `false` |


If you are using Azure CLI for authentication, you can also turn off CLI's telemetry by executing the following [command](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#telemetry-configuration):
```bash 
az config set core.collect_telemetry=false
```

## Resources and Data Sources

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources and data sources.

!> By calling `terraform destroy` all the resources, that you've created, will be deleted permanently deleted. Please be careful with this command when working with production environments. You can use [prevent-destroy](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy) lifecycle argument in your resources to prevent accidental deletion.  

## Examples

More detailed examples can be found in the [Power Platform Terraform Quickstarts](https://github.com/microsoft/power-platform-terraform-quickstarts) repo.  This repo contains a number of examples for using the Power Platform provider to manage environments and other resources within Power Platform along with Azure and Entra.
