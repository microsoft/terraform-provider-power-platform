* [#812](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/issues/812) fix: improve error handling for retry loops, state management, validators, and diagnostic reporting across 9 critical components to prevent silent failures and data corruption
* [#814](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/issues/814) Fixed missing return statements after error handling in three datasources to prevent potential panics and undefined behavior
* [#815](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/issues/815) Add missing nil pointer validation checks to prevent runtime panics in application API client, authorization resource, and environment models
* [#816](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/issues/816) Improved error handling and diagnostics across multiple services: fixed missing parameter context in connection shares error messages, proper error propagation in DLP policy helper functions, handled ignored errors in data record column conversion, and corrected misleading error messages in environment settings
* [#817](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/issues/817) Fixed JSON Marshal/Unmarshal issues: added empty response body validation, proper error handling for JSON marshaling, safe type assertions, and corrected Decode usage
* [#818](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/issues/818) Fixed infinite polling loop in environment wave UpdateFeature method by adding context deadline checking to respect timeout configuration
* [#820](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/issues/820) Improve code structure and maintainability by extracting deeply nested schema definitions into helper functions, reducing duplication in DTO conversion logic, and enhancing error handling for feature state mapping
